But without the contract of deposit, a court cannot determine whether the contract is substantially in the form provided by subsection (a). Extrinsic evidence as to the depositor’s intent then becomes relevant in determining the ownership of the account and its proceeds.

And in a dispute regarding the ownership of an account arising from the depositor’s death, such intent must be proved by a greater weight of the evidence.

Thus, in order to succeed in proving intent, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a movant must prove his or her case by a greater weight of the evidence only. Krzycki v. Krzycki, 284 Neb. 729, 824 N.W.2d 659 (2012).</para><para>This section provides that extrinsic evidence of the depositor's intent as to what type of account was created is relevant only when the contract of deposit in not in substantially the form provided in subsection (a) of this section. When the contract of deposit for an account is substantially in such form, the account will be treated as being the type of account designated on the form; if the contract of deposit is not in such form, then the depositor's intent is relevant to determine the type of account pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
