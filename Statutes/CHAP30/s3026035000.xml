The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the conservator if one has been appointed. A request is not effective unless it contains a statement showing the interest of the person making it and his address, or that of his attorney, and is effective only as to matters occurring after the filing. Any governmental agency paying or planning to pay benefits to the person to be protected is an interested person in protective proceedings.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 253, UPC &#167; 5-406. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
