If an appellant fails to comply with this subsection, the Court of Appeals on motion and notice may take such action, including dismissal of the appeal, as is just.</para><para>(4) The appeal shall be a supersedeas for the matter from which the appeal is specifically taken, but not for any other matter.

Once the appeal is perfected, the court having jurisdiction over the appeal may, upon motion of any party to the action, reimpose or remove the supersedeas or require the appealing party to deposit with the clerk of the court a bond or other security approved by the court in an amount and conditioned in accordance with sections 30-2640 and 30-2641. Upon motion of any interested person or upon the court's own motion, the county court may appoint a special guardian or conservator pending appeal despite any supersedeas order.</para><para>(5) The judgment of the Court of Appeals shall not vacate the judgment in the county court. The judgment of the Court of Appeals shall be certified without cost to the county court for further proceedings consistent with the determination of the Court of Appeals.</para><para>(6) If it appears to the Court of Appeals that an appeal was taken vexatiously or for delay, the court shall adjudge that the appellant shall pay the cost thereof, including an attorney's fee, to the adverse party in an amount fixed by the Court of Appeals, and any bond required under subsection (3) of this section shall be liable for the costs. In a proceeding under sections 30-701 to 30-713, the Court of Appeals may also order remedies under section 30-705.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1881, c. 47, &#167; 1, p. 227; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 1526; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 1471; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 30-1601; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 30-1601; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 481, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 42, &#167; 17; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 538, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 466, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 43, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 130, &#167; 119; </para><para>Laws 2011, LB157, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2018, LB104, &#167; 21;  </para><para>Laws 2018, LB845, &#167; 14. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Health Care Surrogacy Act,</emphasis> see section 30-601.</para><para><emphasis>Nebraska Probate Code,</emphasis> see section 30-2201.</para><para><emphasis>Nebraska Uniform Trust Code,</emphasis> see section 30-3801.</para></crossreference><annotation><para><emphasis>1.
