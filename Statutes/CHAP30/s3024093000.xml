In determining a claim against an estate a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess. A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based. A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 171, UPC &#167; 3-811. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
