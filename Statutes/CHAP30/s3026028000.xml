rights, and duties of guardian; inventory.</catchline><para>(a) Except
as limited by section 30-2620, a guardian of an incapacitated person has the
same powers, rights, and duties respecting the guardian's ward that a parent
has respecting the parent's unemancipated minor child, except that a guardian
is not liable to third persons for acts of the ward solely by reason of the
parental relationship. In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing,
a guardian has the following powers and duties, except as may be specified
by order of the court:</para>
<para>(1) To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of
any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment
of the ward, a guardian is entitled to custody of the person of his or her
ward and may establish the ward's place of abode within this state or, with
court permission, outside of this
state. When establishing the ward's place of abode, a guardian shall make
every reasonable effort to ensure that the placement is the least restrictive
alternative. A guardian shall authorize a placement to a more restrictive
environment only after careful evaluation of the need for such placement.
The guardian may obtain a professional evaluation or assessment that such
placement is in the best interest of the ward.</para>
<para>(2) If entitled to custody of his or her ward, a guardian
shall make provision for the care, comfort, and maintenance of his or her
ward and, whenever appropriate, arrange for the ward's training and education.
Without regard to custodial rights of the ward's person, a guardian shall
take reasonable care of his or her ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and
other personal effects and commence protective proceedings if other property
of his or her ward is in need of protection.</para>
<para>(3) A guardian may give any consents or approvals that may
be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical, psychiatric, psychological,
or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service. When making such
medical or psychiatric decisions, the guardian shall consider and carry out
the intent of the ward expressed prior to incompetency to the extent allowable
by law. Notwithstanding this provision or any other provision of the Nebraska
Probate Code, the ward may authorize the release of financial, medical, and
other confidential records pursuant to sections 20-161 to 20-166.</para>
<para>(4) If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been
appointed, a guardian shall, within thirty days after appointment, prepare
and file with the appointing court a complete inventory of the ward's estate
together with the guardian's oath or affirmation that the inventory is complete
and accurate so far as the guardian is informed. The guardian shall mail a
copy thereof by first-class mail to the ward, if the ward can be located and
has attained the age of fourteen years, and to all other interested persons
as defined in section 30-2601. The
guardian shall file with the court a certificate of mailing showing that copies
were sent to all interested persons by first-class mail along with a form
to send back to the court that indicates if such person wants to continue
receiving notifications about the proceedings. The guardian shall
keep suitable records of the guardian's administration and exhibit the same
on request of any interested person. To the extent a guardian, who has not
been named a conservator, has possession or control of the ward's estate,
the guardian shall file with the court an updated inventory every year along
with a certificate of mailing showing
that copies were sent to all interested persons and, if a bond has been required,
to the bonding company by first-class mail.</para>
<para>(5) If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been
appointed, a guardian may:</para>
<para>(i) Institute proceedings to compel any person under a duty
to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward to perform
such person's duty;</para>
<para>(ii) Receive money and tangible property deliverable to the
ward and apply the money and property for support, care, and education of
the ward; but a guardian may not use funds from his or her ward's estate for
room and board which the guardian or the guardian's spouse, parent, or child
has furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order
of the court made upon notice to at least one of the next of kin of the ward,
if notice is possible. A guardian must exercise care to conserve any excess
for the ward's needs; and</para>
<para>(iii) Exercise a settlor's powers with respect to revocation,
amendment, or distribution of trust property when authorized by a court acting
under the authority of subsection (f) of section 30-3854. In acting under
the authority of subsection (f) of section 30-3854, the court shall proceed
in the same manner as provided under subdivision (3) of section 30-2637.</para>
<para>(6) A guardian is required to report the condition of his
or her ward and of the estate which has been subject to the guardian's possession
or control, at least every year and as required by the court or court rule.
The court shall receive from any interested person, for a period of thirty
days after the filing of the guardian's report, any comments with regard to
the need for continued guardianship or amendment of the guardianship order.
If the court has reason to believe that additional rights should be returned
to the ward or assigned to the guardian, the court shall set a date for a
hearing and may provide all protections as set forth for the original finding
of incapacity and appointment of a guardian.</para>
<para>(7) If a conservator has been appointed, all of the ward's
estate received by the guardian in excess of those funds expended to meet
current expenses for support, care, and education of the ward must be paid
to the conservator for management as provided in the Nebraska Probate Code,
and the guardian must account to the conservator for funds expended.</para>
<para>(b) Any guardian of one for whom a conservator also has been
appointed shall control the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to
receive reasonable sums for the guardian's services and for room and board
furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the conservator
if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances. The guardian
may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment to third
persons or institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.</para>
<para>(c) Nothing in subdivision (a)(3) of this section or in any
other part of this section shall be construed to alter the decisionmaking
authority of an attorney in fact designated and authorized under sections
30-3401 to 30-3432 to make health care decisions pursuant to a power of attorney
for health care.</para>
