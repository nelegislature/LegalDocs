In determining the validity of a holographic instrument, only the portion of the instrument actually in the handwriting of the testator is to be considered; all other language is to be disregarded.

    within the document itself could not be legally recognized as a valid holographic will. Absent a latent ambiguity,
    extrinsic evidence could not be considered to aid in that determination. In re Estate of Tiedeman, 25 Neb. App. 722,
    912 N.W.2d 816 (2018).
</para><para>A holographic will must contain sufficient material provisions, meaning words which express donative and
    testamentary intent. Donative intent relates to words reflecting specific bequests to particular beneficiaries, and
    testamentary intent concerns whether the document was intended to be a will. In re Estate of Tiedeman, 25 Neb.
    App. 722, 912 N.W.2d 816 (2018).</para><para>In determining the intent of the testator when he or she used controverted words in a holographic will, the court should place itself in the shoes of the testator, ascertain his or her intention, and enforce it, remembering at all times that the testator was unskilled in the field of will drafting.
