For this purpose the property advanced is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the decedent, whichever first occurs. If the recipient of the property fails to survive the decedent, the property is not taken into account in computing the intestate share to be received by the recipient's issue, unless the declaration or acknowledgment provides otherwise.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 32, UPC &#167; 2-110. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
