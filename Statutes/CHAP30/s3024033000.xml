Any will found to be valid and unrevoked shall be formally probated. Termination of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by section 30-2455. The petition shall be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the other place.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 111, UPC &#167; 3-409; </para><para>Laws 1978, LB 650, &#167; 11. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
