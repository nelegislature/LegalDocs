    <annotation><para>A beneficiary must be "definite." A class of beneficiaries is not indefinite merely because it consists of a changing or shifting group, the number of whose members may increase or decrease.  Typical examples of definite classes for trust beneficiaries are "children" or "grandchildren," the "issue" or "descendants," or the "heirs" or "next of kin" of a designated person.  In re William R. Zutavern Revocable Trust, 309 Neb. 542, 961 N.W.2d 807 (2021).</para><para>The provision in subsection (b) of this section that a "beneficiary is definite if the beneficiary can be ascertained now or in the future" did not change the common-law rule that the beneficiary must be ascertainable from the trust instrument.
