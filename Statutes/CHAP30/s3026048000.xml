<para>Every conservator must account to the court for his or her administration of the
trust annually, upon
his or her resignation
or removal, and at such other
times as the court may direct. On termination of the protected person's minority
or disability, a conservator may account to the court, or the
conservator may account to the former protected person or the former protected person's personal representative.
Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon
notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates
as to the conservator's liabilities
concerning the matters considered in connection therewith; and an order, made
upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously
unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to
the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require
a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in his or her control, to be made
in any manner the court may specify.</para>
