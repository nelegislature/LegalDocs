<para>(f) A final judgment of conviction
of felonious and intentional killing or aiding and abetting therein is conclusive

therein was felonious and intentional for purposes of this section.</para>

affect the rights of any person who, before rights under this section have
been adjudicated, purchases, from the killer or aider and abettor for value
and without notice, property which the killer or aider and abettor would have
acquired except for this section, but the killer or aider and abettor is liable
for the amount of the proceeds or the value of the property. Any insurance
company, bank, or other obligor making payment according to the terms of its
policy or obligation is not liable by reason of this section unless prior
to payment it has received at its home office or principal address written
notice of a claim under this section.</para>
