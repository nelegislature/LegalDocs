Except as required for proceedings which are particularly described by other sections of this article, no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final order; (3) proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives; and (4) a proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 85, UPC &#167; 3-107. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
