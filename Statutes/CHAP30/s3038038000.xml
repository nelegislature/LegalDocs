The possible imposition of such a duty on a trustee further supports permitting a trustee to seek modification under this section even in those instances where a trust may have terminated or expired by its own terms, but the winding up and distribution of trust property is still pending.

The application of equitable deviation allows a court to modify the dispositive provisions of a trust, as well as its administrative terms. The purpose of equitable deviation is not to disregard the settlor's intent but to modify inopportune details to effectuate better the settlor's broader purpose.
