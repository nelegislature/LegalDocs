If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of the Uniform Trust Decanting Act other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in 26 U.S.C. 2503(b), as such section existed on November 14, 2020, by application of 26 U.S.C. 2503(c), as such section existed on November 14, 2020, the second-trust instrument must not include or omit a term that, if included or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying under 26 U.S.C. 2503(c), as such section existed on November 14, 2020.</para><para>(4) If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1361, as such section existed on November 14, 2020, and the first trust is, or but for provisions of the Uniform Trust Decanting Act other than this section would be, a permitted shareholder under any provision of 26 U.S.C. 1361, as such section existed on November 14, 2020, an authorized fiduciary may exercise the power with respect to part or all of the S-corporation stock only if any second trust receiving the stock is a permitted shareholder under 26 U.S.C. 1361(c)(2), as such section existed on November 14, 2020.
