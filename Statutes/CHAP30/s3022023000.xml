of the decedent's remains occurring prior to appointment the same effect as
those occurring thereafter. Prior to appointment, the personal representative

<para>(3) A person
entitled under this section to the right of disposition shall forfeit that
right and the right is passed on to the next qualifying person as listed in
subdivisions (2)(a) through (l) of this section in the following circumstances:</para>
<para>(a) Any person
charged with first or second degree murder or voluntary manslaughter in connection
with the decedent's death and whose charges are known to the funeral director.
If the charges against such person are dismissed, or if such person is acquitted
of the charges, the right of disposition is returned to such person;</para>

who does not exercise his or her right of disposition within three days after
notification of the death of the decedent or within four days after the decedent's

determines that the person entitled to the right of disposition and the decedent
were estranged at the time of death. For purposes of this subdivision, estranged
means a physical and emotional separation from the decedent at the time of
death which has existed for a period of time that clearly demonstrates an
absence of due affection, trust, and regard for the decedent.</para>
<para>(4)(a) If two

of the decedent's remains, any of such persons or a funeral home with custody
of the remains may file a petition asking the court to make a determination
in the matter.</para><para>(b) Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) of this section,
the county court of the county where the decedent died may award the right
of disposition to the person determined by the court to be the most fit and
appropriate to carry out the right of disposition and may make decisions regarding
the decedent's remains if those sharing the right of disposition cannot agree.</para>
<para>(c) In making
a determination under this subsection, the court shall consider the following:</para>
<para>(i) The reasonableness
and practicality of the proposed funeral arrangements and disposition;</para>
<para>(ii) The degree
of the personal relationship between the decedent and each of the persons
claiming the right of disposition;</para><para>(iii) The desires of the person or persons
who are ready, able, and willing to pay the cost of the funeral arrangements
and disposition; and</para><para>(iv) The convenience and needs of other families and friends wishing
to pay respects.</para><para>(d) In the event of a dispute regarding the right of disposition,
a funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory authority is not liable for
refusing to accept the remains or to inter or otherwise dispose of the remains
of the decedent or complete the arrangements for the final disposition of
the remains until the funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory authority
receives a court order or other written agreement signed by the parties in
disagreement that decides the final disposition of the remains. If the funeral
establishment, cemetery, or crematory authority retains the remains for final
disposition while the parties are in disagreement, the funeral establishment
may embalm or refrigerate and shelter the body, or both, in order to preserve
it while awaiting the final decision of the court and may add the cost of
embalming or refrigeration and sheltering to the final disposition costs.
If a funeral home brings an action under this subsection, the funeral establishment,
cemetery, or crematory authority may add the legal fees and court costs associated
with a petition under this subsection to the cost of final disposition. This
subsection may not be construed to require or to impose a duty upon a funeral
establishment, cemetery, or crematory authority to bring an action under this
subsection.</para><para>(e) Except to the degree it may be considered by the court under
subdivision (4)(c)(iii) of this section, the fact that a person has paid or
agreed to pay for all or part of the funeral arrangements and final disposition
does not give that person a greater claim to the right of disposition than
the person would otherwise have. The personal representative of the estate
of the decedent does not, by virtue of being the personal representative,
have a greater claim to the right of disposition than the personal representative
would otherwise have.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2014, LB998, &#167; 8.</para></source>  </law>
