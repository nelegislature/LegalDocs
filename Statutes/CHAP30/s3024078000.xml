This restriction does not apply when any corepresentative receives and receipts for property due the estate, when the concurrence of all cannot readily be obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to preserve the estate, when a corepresentative has been delegated to act for the others, or as provided in section 30-901.
