If local assets are not sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this state the amount to which they are entitled, local assets shall be marshaled so that each claim allowed in this state is paid its proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all dividends on claims allowed in this state from assets in other jurisdictions.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 175, UPC &#167; 3-815. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
