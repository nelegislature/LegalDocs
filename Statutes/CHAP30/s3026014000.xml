Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court. A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 232, UPC &#167; 5-210. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
