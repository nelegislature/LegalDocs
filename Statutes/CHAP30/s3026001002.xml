It is the intent of the Legislature to authorize the use of guardianships and conservatorships for such intervention. It is also the intent of the Legislature to encourage the least restrictive alternative possible on the impaired person's exercise of personal and civil rights consistent with the impaired person's need for services by encouraging judges to utilize limited guardianships if appropriate.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 466, &#167; 4. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
