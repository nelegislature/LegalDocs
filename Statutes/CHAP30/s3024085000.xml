    <para>For purposes of this section, a demand against the trust assets is not a claim against the decedent's estate. In re Estate of Giventer, 310 Neb. 39, 964 N.W.2d 234 (2021).</para><para>Because the Nebraska Probate Code requires that all claims, whether absolute or contingent, be presented within certain time periods or be barred against the estate, a contingency's unfulfilled status does not automatically defeat a claim. In re Estate of Ryan, 302 Neb. 821, 925 N.W.2d 336 (2019).</para><para>A court cannot extend the time for filing a claim that arose after death. In re Estate of Karmazin, 299 Neb. 315, 908 N.W.2d 381 (2018).</para><para>The 3-year limitations period of subsection (a)(2) of this section applied to the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicaid estate recovery claim because the personal representative failed to send notice to the department within 5 days of the date on which notice to creditors was first published, as required by sections 30-2483 and 25-520.01. In re Estate of Cushing, 283 Neb. 571, 810 N.W.2d 741 (2012).</para><para>Time limitations set forth in subsection (a) of this section applied to the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicaid estate recovery claim, because under the section, under which the claim was made, section 68-919, the indebtedness to the department arose during the lifetime of the recipient. In re Estate of Cushing, 283 Neb. 571, 810 N.W.2d 741 (2012).</para><para>A claim against a decedent's estate which is excepted from the time limitations of this section remains subject to the statute of limitations governing the underlying claim.

In re Estate of Tvrz, 260 Neb. 991, 620 N.W.2d 757 (2001).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, a judgment lien on the proceeds from a sale is not a claim subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Probate Code. A judgment lien is not a claim and is not subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Probate Code. McCook Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 248 Neb. 567, 537 N.W.2d 353 (1995).</para><para>The purpose of the nonclaim statute is facilitation and expedition of proceedings for distribution of a decedent's estate, including an early appraisal of the respective rights of interested persons and prompt settlement of demands against the estate.

    <para><emphasis>2. Miscellaneous</emphasis></para><para>A widow's suit for $100,000 and a camper was not subject to the requirements of this section, because under the terms of a premarital agreement, her suit did not involve a "claim" against the decedent's estate as defined in subsection (4) of section 30-2209. White v. White, 316 Neb. 616, 6 N.W.3d 204 (2024).</para>

Therefore, both subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to creditors who do not receive notice.

In re Estate of Tvrz, 9 Neb. App. 98, 608 N.W.2d 226 (2000).</para><para>Subsection (c) of this section does not provide for a direct action against an insurer, but, rather, an action against the estate of an alleged tort-feasor with the award being limited to the amount of available liability insurance.

App. 758, 602 N.W.2d 27 (1999).</para><para>Administration expenses, including attorney fees, are only excepted from the time-bar provisions for bringing claims.

App. 397, 558 N.W.2d 837 (1997).</para><para>Subsection (c)(2) of this section provides an exception to the general time-bar provisions of the probate code, and establishes a potential creditor's right to have an estate reopened for the limited purpose of service of process in a civil action to establish liability and liability insurance coverage, but this section does not authorize a suit against a former personal representative who has already been discharged for the purpose of establishing liability and insurance coverage.
