The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments. It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise to the children, or persons having their care and custody; but in case any minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or his guardian or other person having his care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except for costs and expenses of administration and the homestead allowance.</para><para>The family allowance is not chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent unless otherwise provided therein, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share. The death of any person entitled to family allowance, other than the surviving spouse, terminates his right to allowances not yet paid.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 46, UPC &#167; 2-403; </para><para>Laws 1978, LB 650, &#167; 6. </para></source><annotation><para>Under this section and section 30-2325, a right to allowances for homestead, exempt property, and unpaid spousal support survives the claimant's death to the extent of unpaid support.
