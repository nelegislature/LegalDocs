The judge or magistrate may so direct only upon proof under oath, to his satisfaction that the property sought may be easily or quickly destroyed or disposed of, or that danger to the life or limb of the officer or another may result, if such notice be given; but this section is not intended to authorize any officer executing a search warrant to enter any house or building not described in the warrant.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>G.S.1873, c. 58, &#167; 293, p. 791; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 8947; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 9971; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 29-411; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 29-411; </para><para>Laws 1965, c. 149, &#167; 1, p. 491. </para></source><annotation><para>Given the facts viewed most favorably to the plaintiff, the defendant officer's statement identifying himself as a sheriff's deputy was insufficient to announce his office and purpose: The officer was dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt, and a ball cap, did not show his badge, displayed a weapon upon entry into the home, and failed to produce a copy of the warrant before or after his forced entry into the home.
