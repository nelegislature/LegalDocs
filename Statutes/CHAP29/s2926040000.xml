The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: Create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, or corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purposes of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, and state criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulation of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefor public business.</para><para>ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS</para><para>As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:</para><para>Adult means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute, or operation of law;</para><para>Bylaws means those bylaws established by the interstate commission for its governance or for directing or controlling the interstate commission's actions or conduct;</para><para>Compact administrator means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the interstate commission, and the policies adopted by the state council under this compact;</para><para>Compacting state means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;</para><para>Commissioner means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact;</para><para>Interstate commission means the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision established by this compact;</para><para>Member means the commissioner of a compacting state or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the commissioner;</para><para>Noncompacting state means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;</para><para>Offender means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies;</para><para>Person means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private;</para><para>Rules means acts of the interstate commission, duly promulgated pursuant to Article VIII of this compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the interstate commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states;</para><para>State means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any other territorial possessions of the United States; and</para><para>State Council means the resident members of the State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision created by each state under Article IV of this compact.</para><para>ARTICLE III THE COMPACT COMMISSION</para><para>The compacting states hereby create the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.
