Probation</emphasis></para><para>When the sentence alleged to be excessively lenient is one of probation, it is necessary for the trial court and the reviewing appellate court to consider the provisions of this section. State v. Hamik, 262 Neb. 761, 635 N.W.2d 123 (2001).</para><para>When determining whether to impose probation, the trial court must consider the factors set forth in this section.

State v. Swails, 195 Neb. 406, 238 N.W.2d 246 (1976).</para><para>An order granting probation is a sentence under section 29-2260(4), and for review a motion for new trial must be filed within ten days, but no motion for new trial is required for review of order revoking probation. State v. Mosley, 194 Neb. 740, 235 N.W.2d 402 (1975).</para><para>A lack of cooperation prior to sentencing could be a strong indication that the lesser restrictions of probation may not be sufficient to effect a purposeful probation. State v. Gundlach, 192 Neb. 692, 224 N.W.2d 167 (1974).</para><para><emphasis>2. Sentencing</emphasis></para><para>Indeterminate sentence of not less than 4 nor more than 15 years' imprisonment was not excessive considering deliberate and premeditated manner in which defendant committed burglary, and in considering his continued disrespect for the law as shown by numerous past violations of the law and probation.

Peterson, 236 Neb. 450, 462 N.W.2d 423 (1990).</para><para>Sentence of life imprisonment for sixteen year old who pleaded guilty to second degree murder of his father is not excessive where a lesser sentence would have depreciated the seriousness of the offense.

State v. McCurry, 198 Neb. 673, 254 N.W.2d 698 (1977).</para><para>The violence with which the offense was committed and that probation would depreciate the seriousness thereof or promote disrespect for law were valid reasons for sentencing first offender to imprisonment. State v. Keen, 196 Neb. 291, 242 N.W.2d 863 (1976).</para><para>Defendant's sentence of seven years for embezzlement, which under law was sentence of one to seven years, was not excessive under facts in this case.

Discretion</emphasis></para><para>The language in this section which provides that the court "may withhold sentence of imprisonment" is merely a guideline and does not mandate a sentence of probation.

State v. Thornton, 225 Neb. 875, 408 N.W.2d 327 (1987).</para><para>The part of this section providing that the court may withhold sentence of imprisonment is a guideline for the court and is not mandatory.

State v. Purviance, 194 Neb. 541, 233 N.W.2d 788 (1975).</para><para>This section gives recognition to fact that probation may be more effective and less expensive than imprisonment, but trial judge did not abuse discretion in sentencing defendant for whom repeated probation for a series of offenses has been tried and failed. State v. Dovel, 189 Neb. 173, 201 N.W.2d 820 (1972).</para><para>There being nothing in the record to show sentence within limits prescribed herein was not a legitimate exercise of judicial discretion to consider the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the offender it will not be disturbed on appeal.

Randolph, 186 Neb. 297, 183 N.W.2d 225 (1971), where the defendant was sentenced concurrently for two Class IV felonies and a Class W misdemeanor and where after sentencing, but while the matter was pending on appeal, 2016 Neb.
