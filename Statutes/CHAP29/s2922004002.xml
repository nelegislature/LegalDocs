        <para><emphasis>1. Determinate or indeterminate sentence</emphasis></para><para>A determinate sentence, as used in subdivision (1)(a) of this section, is imposed when the defendant is sentenced to a single term of years. State v. Vanness, 300 Neb. 159, 912 N.W.2d 736 (2018).</para><para>A determinate sentence is imposed when the defendant is sentenced to a single term of years, such as a sentence of 2 years' imprisonment. In contrast, when imposing an indeterminate sentence, a sentencing court ordinarily articulates either a minimum term and maximum term or a range of time for which a defendant is to be incarcerated. State v. Artis, 296 Neb. 172, 893 N.W.2d 421 (2017).</para><para>In Nebraska, the fact that the minimum term and maximum term of a sentence are the same does not affect the sentence's status as an indeterminate sentence. State v. Artis, 296 Neb. 172, 893 N.W.2d 421 (2017).</para>
        
        <para><emphasis>2. Sentence of probation</emphasis></para><para>A determination of whether there are substantial and compelling reasons under subdivision (2)(c) of this section is within the trial court's discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.

Baxter, 295 Neb. 496, 888 N.W.2d 726 (2017).</para><para>The court may fulfill the requirement of subsection (3) of this section to state its reasoning on the record by a combination of the sentencing hearing and sentencing order. State v. Baxter, 295 Neb. 496, 888 N.W.2d 726 (2017).</para><para>The court's determination of substantial and compelling reasons under subdivision (2)(c) of this section should be based on a review of the record, including the presentence investigation report and the record of the trial, and its determination must be supported by such record.

        <para><emphasis>3. Retroactivity of legislation</emphasis></para><para>The trial court did not plainly err by failing to impose an indeterminate sentence where an information alleged that a Class IIIA felony occurred over a period of time both before and after August 30, 2015; the evidence about when the assaults occurred could cover dates before and after August 30; and the jury did not make a specific finding demonstrating that it found the offense was committed after August 30. State v. Mora, 298 Neb. 185, 903 N.W.2d 244 (2017).</para><para>The defendant's sentence of 2 years' imprisonment with a 12-month period of postrelease supervision for possession of a controlled substance was vacated pursuant to State v. Randolph, 186 Neb. 297, 183 N.W.2d 225 (1971), where the defendant was sentenced concurrently for two Class IV felonies and a Class W misdemeanor and where after sentencing, but while the matter was pending on appeal, 2016 Neb. Laws, L.B. 1094, struck section 29 2260(5) and added subsection (4) of this section, which precluded postrelease supervision. State v. Chacon, 296 Neb. 203, 894 N.W.2d 238 (2017).</para><para>Under the nonretroactive provision of section 28-105(7), the changes made in this section to the penalties for Class IV felony convictions by 2015 Neb. Laws, L.B. 605, do not apply to any offense committed before August 30, 2015. State v. Benavides, 294 Neb. 902, 884 N.W.2d 923 (2016).</para><para>It is clear that the Legislature did not intend to apply this section retroactively. State v. Raatz, 294 Neb. 852, 885 N.W.2d 38 (2016).</para>
        
        <para><emphasis>4. Miscellaneous</emphasis></para><para>A transfer from juvenile court to criminal court does not eliminate the possibility of disposition under the juvenile code. In re Interest of Steven S., 299 Neb. 447, 908 N.W.2d 391 (2018).</para><para>Section 29-2204 and subsection (4) of this section do not require a sentence for a Class IV felony to have a minimum term less than the maximum term.
