State v. Shambley, 281 Neb. 317, 795 N.W.2d 884 (2011).</para><para>While the revocation of probation is a matter entrusted to the discretion of the trial court, unless the probationer admits to a violation of a condition of probation, the state must prove the violation by clear and convincing evidence. State v. Finnegan, 232 Neb. 75, 439 N.W.2d 496 (1989).</para><para>Violation of a single condition of probation established by clear and convincing evidence can support revocation. State v.

Defendant's rights</emphasis></para><para>In a probation revocation proceeding, where the unavailability of the witness was shown and the court found indicia of reliability and corroboration of the witness- hearsay statements through other evidence, good cause had been shown and the court could rely on the hearsay statements in the absence of cross-examination of the witness. State v. Johnson, 287 Neb. 190, 842 N.W.2d 63 (2014).</para><para>If a defendant is incarcerated in another jurisdiction and the State wishes to charge the defendant with violating probation, it provides the defendant with reasonably "prompt consideration" of the charge if the State invokes the detainer process and notifies the defendant of the pending revocation proceedings. Absent unusual circumstances, the State is not required to extradite the defendant to revoke probation and sentence the defendant before the term of the defendant's foreign incarceration expires. State v. Hernandez, 273 Neb. 456, 730 N.W.2d 96 (2007).</para><para>The rights afforded a defendant in probation revocation proceedings do not include a right to remain silent. State v.

Miscellaneous</emphasis></para><para>Where a probationer allegedly committed a new felony&#8212;possession of methamphetamine&#8212;while already on probation for a felony, the allegation of a law violation was not a "substance abuse" violation for revocation of probation purposes and the State could therefore institute revocation proceedings without showing that the probationer had served at least 90 days of cumulative custodial sanctions during the current probation term.

Jedlicka, 305 Neb. 52, 938 N.W.2d 854 (2020). </para><para>If a court is to revoke probation for a violation occurring within the probationary period, it is sufficient if procedure to that end was instituted within the probationary period or within a reasonable time thereafter. State v. Hernandez, 273 Neb. 456, 730 N.W.2d 96 (2007).</para><para>In evaluating the reasonableness of a delay in probation revocation proceedings, a court should consider such factors as the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and the prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.

Daniels, 224 Neb. 264, 397 N.W.2d 631 (1986).</para><para>A motion or information to revoke probation must be filed in the sentencing court followed by a prompt preliminary hearing before an independent officer.
