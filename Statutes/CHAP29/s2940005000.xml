    find that a defendant committed an aggravated offense as defined in section 29-4001.01 and to inform the defendant
    that he or she is thus required to register for life under subdivision (1)(b)(iii) of this section. State v. Wilson, 306

State v. Simnick, 279 Neb. 499, 779 N.W.2d 335 (2010).</para><para>A sentencing judge may determine whether an aggravated offense as formerly defined in subsection (4)(a) of this section has been committed based upon information contained in the record, including the factual basis for a plea-based conviction and information contained in the presentence report. State v. Hamilton, 277 Neb. 593, 763 N.W.2d 731 (2009).</para><para>The plain language of this section states that when sentencing a person, the court "shall" provide written notification and copies of the notification and corresponding journal entry to various parties. Thus, the requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act are mandatory. State v. Pathod, 269 Neb. 155, 690 N.W.2d 784 (2005).</para><para>Because subsection (2) of this section requires the sentencing court to include the finding of an aggravated offense as part of the sentencing order, the registration requirements for an aggravated offense are part of the court's judgment for purposes of filing a direct appeal. State v. Worm, 268 Neb. 74, 680 N.W.2d 151 (2004).</para><para>The lifetime registration requirement under subsection (2) of this section is not criminal punishment. State v. Worm, 268 Neb. 74, 680 N.W.2d 151 (2004).</para>
<para>A defendant who had a prior conviction for a registrable offense under the Sex Offender Registration Act could challenge on direct appeal a lifetime registration requirement, because the sentencing court must make a finding of fact concerning lifetime registration as part of the sentencing order. State v. Aguilar-Moreno, 17 Neb. App. 623, 769 N.W.2d 784 (2009).</para>
<para>The plain language of this section requires that when making a determination that a person is a sexually violent offender, the sentencing court shall consider evidence from experts in the field of the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders.
