The police chief obstructed or impaired a governmental function by failing to forward the citation to the county attorney, as required by this section, because the action of failing to forward the citation impaired the county attorney's performance of its prosecutorial functions. The police chief did not have discretion to remove the citation of the city employee from the packet of citations to be sent to the county attorney such to conclude that he did not breach this section.
