<para>Under section 43-2,106.01(2)(d), when a county attorney files an appeal "in any case determining delinquency issues in which the juvenile has been placed legally in jeopardy," the appeal must be taken by exception

<para><emphasis>2. Miscellaneous</emphasis></para>
<para>This section requires exception to a county court judgment to be taken to the district court sitting as an appellate court. Specifically, the prosecuting attorney is to file a notice of appeal in the county court, 
then file the notice in the district court within 30 days. In re Interest 
of Rebecca B., 280 Neb. 137, 783 N.W.2d 783 (2010).</para><para>The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and thus properly dismissed the State's appeal of a criminal prosecution brought pursuant to this section, where, before filing notice of its intent to appeal to the district court, the State voluntarily dismissed the case in the county court.

Rubek, 220 Neb. 537, 371 N.W.2d 537 (1985).</para><para>This section provides no means of appeal for a defendant who has previously been placed in jeopardy since a proceeding under this section cannot subsequently affect that defendant's rights.
