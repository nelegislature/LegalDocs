Providing a record of the statement made during a custodial interrogation and any waiver of constitutional rights will reduce speculation and claims that may arise as to the content of the statement. Such a record of the content of the statement will aid law enforcement officers in analyzing and rejecting untruthful statements and will aid the factfinder in determining whether a statement was freely, knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2008, LB179, &#167;  1.</para></source>  </law></legaldoc>
