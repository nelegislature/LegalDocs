six months; time; how computed.</catchline><para>(1) Every person
indicted or informed against for any offense shall be brought to trial within
six months, and such time shall be computed as provided in this section.</para>
<para>(2) Such six-month period shall commence to run from the date
the indictment is returned or the information filed, unless the offense is
a misdemeanor offense involving intimate partners, as that term is defined
in section 28-323, in which case the six-month period shall commence from
the date the defendant is arrested on a complaint filed as part of a warrant
for arrest.</para>
<para>(3) If a defendant is to be tried again following a mistrial,
an order for a new trial, or an appeal or collateral attack, such period shall
commence to run from the date of the mistrial, order granting a new trial,
or the mandate on remand.</para>
<para>(4) The following periods shall be excluded in computing the
time for trial:</para>
<para>(a) The period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning
the defendant, including, but not limited to, an examination and hearing on
competency and the period during which he or she is incompetent to stand trial;
the time from filing until final disposition of pretrial motions of the defendant,
including motions to suppress evidence, motions to quash the indictment or
information, demurrers and pleas in abatement, and motions for a change of
venue; and the time consumed in the trial of other charges against the defendant;</para>
<para>(b) The period of delay resulting from a continuance granted
at the request or with the consent of the defendant or his or her counsel.
A defendant without counsel shall not be deemed to have consented to a continuance
unless he or she has been advised by the court of his or her right to a speedy
trial and the effect of his or her consent.
A defendant who has sought and obtained a continuance which is indefinite
has an affirmative duty to end the continuance by giving notice of request
for trial or the court can end the continuance by setting a trial date. When
the court ends an indefinite continuance by setting a trial date, the excludable
period resulting from the indefinite continuance ends on the date for which
trial commences. A defendant is deemed to have waived his or her right to
speedy trial when the period of delay resulting from a continuance granted
at the request of the defendant or his or her counsel extends the trial date
beyond the statutory six-month period;</para>
<para>(c) The period of delay resulting from a continuance granted
at the request of the prosecuting attorney, if:</para>
<para>(i) The continuance is granted because of the unavailability
of evidence material to the state's case, when the prosecuting attorney has
exercised due diligence to obtain such evidence and there are reasonable grounds
to believe that such evidence will be available at the later date; or</para>
<para>(ii) The continuance is granted to allow the prosecuting attorney
additional time to prepare the state's case and additional time is justified
because of the exceptional circumstances of the case;</para>
<para>(d) The period of delay resulting from the absence or unavailability
of the defendant;</para>
<para>(e) A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined
for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and
there is good cause for not granting a severance. In all other cases, the
defendant shall be granted a severance so that he or she may be tried within
the time limits applicable to him or her; and</para>
<para>(f) Other periods of delay not specifically enumerated in
this section, but only if the court finds that they are for good cause.</para>

Pursuant to the Nebraska Supreme Court's case law interpreting the speedy trial act, the statutory 6-month speedy trial time period begins to run the day following the filing of the information, and in the case of a direct information, the day the information is filed for speedy trial act purposes is the day the district court finds probable cause or the day the defendant waives the preliminary hearing.

Amended or refiled charges</emphasis></para><para>The original charges have not been "abandoned" or "dismissed" when an amended complaint or information continues to make those charges, but additionally charges a different crime, and, therefore, the 6-month statutory speedy trial period continues to run as to the charges that have not changed, and a tacking-and-tolling analysis as to those charges is superfluous.

State v. Moore, 312 Neb. 263, 978 N.W.2d 327 (2022).</para><para>The statutory phrase "including, but not limited to" means the pretrial motions listed under subdivision (4)(a) of this section are provided as examples and are not intended to be an exhaustive list.

Thus, periods to be excluded under subdivision (4)(a) of this section include the period of time between the denial of a defendant's pretrial motion and the filing of an interlocutory appeal from that motion, if such appeal is filed.

A defendant may terminate his waiver of a speedy trial by filing a written request for trial with the clerk of the court in which the defendant is to be tried. From the date the defendant files his written request for trial, the six-month period for the state to bring a defendant to trial provided in this section shall begin anew. State v. Andersen, 232 Neb. 187, 440 N.W.2d 203 (1989).</para><para>Where a defendant has waived his right to a speedy trial and thereafter withdraws that waiver and renews his request for a speedy trial, the time between the initial waiver and the later request to withdraw must be excluded from the computation of the six-month period. State v. Williams, 211 Neb. 650, 319 N.W.2d 748 (1982).</para><para>The failure of the accused to object to the setting of a trial date more than six months after charges were filed did not constitute a waiver of his rights under this section. State v. Kinstler, 207 Neb. 386, 299 N.W.2d 182 (1980).</para><para>It was not the duty of the trial court to suggest to the defendant or his counsel that he file a motion for discharge. State v. Hert, 192 Neb. 751, 224 N.W.2d 188 (1974).</para><para>Once a defendant has unconditionally waived his or her right to a speedy trial, it is his or her burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the waiver was conditional or was otherwise invalid. State v. Herngren, 8 Neb. App. 207, 590 N.W.2d 871 (1999).</para>
    
    <para><emphasis>15. Interplay with constitutional speedy trial requirement</emphasis></para><para>A defendant's appeal of a final order denying a pretrial motion for absolute discharge on statutory speedy trial grounds did not result in appellate jurisdiction to review a nonfinal order that denied the motion on constitutional speedy trial grounds. State v. Abernathy, 310 Neb. 880, 969 N.W.2d 871 (2022).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the constitutional right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI and Neb. Const. art. I, section 11; the constitutional right to a speedy trial and the statutory implementation of that right exist independently of each other. State v. Karch, 263 Neb. 230, 639 N.W.2d 118 (2002).</para><para>The constitutional right to a speedy trial and the statutory implementation of that right under this section exist independently of each other. Determining whether a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated requires a balancing test in which courts must approach each case on an ad hoc basis. This balancing test involves four factors: length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of the right, and prejudice to the defendant. None of these four factors standing alone is a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, the factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. State v. Andersen, 232 Neb. 187, 440 N.W.2d 203 (1989).</para><para>The constitutional right to a speedy trial and the statutory implementation of that right under this section exist independently of each other. State v. Sardeson, 231 Neb. 586, 437 N.W.2d 473 (1989).</para><para>Although the constitutional right to a speedy trial and the statutory implementation of that right exist independently of each other, this section provides a useful standard for assessing whether the length of the delay is unreasonable under the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions. State v. Schmader, 13 Neb. App. 321, 691 N.W.2d 559 (2005).</para><para>The 6-month timeframe provided by this section is a useful standard for assessing whether the length of the delay under the Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 1282, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972), speedy trial test is unreasonable under the Constitutions, both state and federal. State v. Robinson, 12 Neb. App. 897, 687 N.W.2d 15 (2004).</para>
    
    <para><emphasis>16. Miscellaneous</emphasis></para><para>For purposes of speedy trial calculation, there is no meaningful distinction between the phrases "period of time" and "period of delay." State v. Coomes, 309 Neb. 749, 962 N.W.2d 510 (2021); State v. Feldhacker, 267 Neb. 145, 672 N.W.2d 627 (2004).</para><para>A Nebraska prisoner sought relief under two different speedy trial statutes, but only section 29-3805, governing intrastate detainers, applied. State v. Kolbjornsen, 295 Neb. 231, 888 N.W.2d 153 (2016).</para><para>"Misdemeanor offense involving intimate partners," within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, does not encompass any and all misdemeanors in which intimate partners may be engaged. Rather, the exception applies only to those misdemeanor offenses in which the involvement of an "intimate partner" is an element of the offense. State v. Lebeau, 280 Neb. 238, 784 N.W.2d 921 (2010).</para> <para>A court may not apply Nebraska's 6-month speedy trial statute under this section to determine whether a prisoner is timely brought to trial under article III(a) of the Agreement on Detainers. State v. Rieger, 270 Neb. 904, 708 N.W.2d 630 (2006).</para><para>Subsection (3) of this section does not apply to a defendant who has not yet been brought to trial. State v. Baker, 264 Neb. 867, 652 N.W.2d 612 (2002).</para><para>Once the operation of Nebraska's speedy trial statutes have been triggered by the filing of an indictment or information, the statutory right of a defendant under the control of prosecuting authorities who knowingly extradite him or her to another state or to federal authorities is governed by this section, not the Agreement on Detainers. State v. Steele, 261 Neb. 541, 624 N.W.2d 1 (2001).</para> <para>For purposes of this section, the date of the mandate on remand is the date on which the district court first takes action pursuant to the mandate. State v. White, 257 Neb. 943, 601 N.W.2d 731 (1999).</para><para>For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the date of the "mandate on remand" is the date on which the district court first takes action pursuant to the mandate. State v. Kinser, 256 Neb. 56, 588 N.W.2d 794 (1999).</para><para>A ruling on a motion for absolute discharge based upon an accused criminal's nonfrivolous claim that his or her statutory speedy trial rights were violated is final and appealable. For the purpose of determining whether an accused's speedy trial rights under this section have been violated, successive informations charging the same offenses are not to be considered separately. Where a retrial is ordered, it is the trial for the specific criminal offenses originally charged and other offenses required by law to be joined therewith that must begin within 6 months of the retrial order, not a trial on a specific information. State v. Gibbs, 253 Neb. 241, 570 N.W.2d 326 (1997).</para><para>The speedy trial act also applies to prosecutions on complaint. State v. Vrtiska, 227 Neb. 600, 418 N.W.2d 758 (1988).</para><para>Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of the right to speedy trial, and prejudice to the defendant are factors to consider in the balancing process which weighs the conduct of both the State and the defendant. These factors did not need to be considered where a delay of 17 weeks from the return of a mandate to a trial did not constitute an unreasonable delay. State v. Palmer, 224 Neb. 282, 399 N.W.2d 706 (1986).</para><para>It is the state's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been compliance with this section. State v. Bennett, 219 Neb. 601, 365 N.W.2d 423 (1985).</para><para>Unreasonable delays occurring prior to the filing of an information will be considered in determining whether a defendant has been denied a speedy trial. State v. Gingrich, 211 Neb. 786, 320 N.W.2d 445 (1982).</para><para>Under time schedule of this case, defendant was not denied his constitutional or statutory right to a speedy trial. State v.

State v. Stevens, 189 Neb. 487, 203 N.W.2d 499 (1973).</para><para>After a mistrial has been granted, the filing of a plea in bar tolls the speedy trial clock from the date of the initial filing until final disposition; such tolling would include the time from the district court's decision on the motion through the filing of the mandate on remand if any interlocutory appeal is taken. State v. Ramos, 31 Neb. App. 434, 981 N.W.2d 612 (2022).</para><para>The statutory speedy trial rights of instate prisoners are governed by sections 29-3801 to 29-3809, and the procedure under this section does not apply to instate prisoners. State v. LeFever, 30 Neb. App. 562, 970 N.W.2d 792 (2022).</para><para>The phrase "period of delay," as used in subsection (4) of this section, is synonymous with the phrase "period of time." State v. Fioramonti, 22 Neb. App. 52, 847 N.W.2d 95 (2014).</para><para>As a general rule, a trial court's determination as to whether charges should be dismissed on statutory speedy trial grounds is a factual question which will be affirmed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. State v. Henshaw, 19 Neb. App. 663, 812 N.W.2d 913 (2012).</para><para>A plea agreement not entered into on the record before any court or tribunal, but, rather, made during private negotiations between the parties, is not a "proceeding" within the meaning of subsection (4)(a) of this section. State v. Vasquez, 16 Neb. App. 406, 744 N.W.2d 500 (2008).</para><para>Because a transcript of a previous court proceeding is something to which a defendant would normally be entitled as a matter of right and because a praecipe is simply a directive to the court reporter to prepare such official transcript, the time period while the reporter prepares the transcript is simply trial preparation and does not automatically become a period of delay under this section.
