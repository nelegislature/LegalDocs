Where the circumstances are detailed and reasons for crediting a source of information are given resulting in a finding of probable cause by the magistrate, the court should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hyper-technical manner and should find it sufficient if it will support the issuance of a warrant after the deletion of any inaccurate statements.
