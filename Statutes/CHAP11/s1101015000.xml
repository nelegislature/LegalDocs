office neglects to have his or her official bond executed
and approved as provided by law and
filed for record within the time limited by sections 11-101 to 11-122, the
officer with whom the bond is required to be filed shall immediately issue
an order to such person to show cause why he or she has failed to properly file such bond
and why his or her office
should not be declared vacant. If such person properly files the official
bond within ten days of the issuance of the show cause order for appointed
officials or before the date for taking office for elected officials, such
filing shall be deemed to be in compliance with sections 11-101 to 11-122.
If such person does not file the bond within ten days of the issuance of such
order for appointed officials or before the date for taking office for elected
officials and
sufficient cause is not shown within that time, his or her office shall thereupon ipso facto become
vacant, and such vacancy shall thereupon immediately be filled by election
or appointment as the law may direct in other cases of vacancy in the same
office. This section does not
apply to county officers covered pursuant to subdivision (22) of section 11-119.</para>
