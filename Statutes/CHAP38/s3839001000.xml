If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compact states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the Compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</para><para>3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature or the Speaker if no such leaders exist, and each of the compact states.</para><para>4. A compact state which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.</para><para>5. The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.</para><para>6.

The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.</para><para>C. Dispute Resolution</para><para>1. Upon request by a compact state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact which arise among compact states and between compact and noncompact states.</para><para>2.

The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the Compact.</para><para>2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the State of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.</para><para>3. The remedies in this Article shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</para><para>ARTICLE XIII</para><para>DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS</para><para>A. The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact is enacted into law in the seventh compact state.

Any state which joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission’s initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule which has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.</para><para>C. Any compact state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</para><para>1. A compact state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.</para><para>2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s state psychology regulatory authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of the Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</para><para>D. Nothing contained in the Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a compact state and a noncompact state which does not conflict with the Compact.</para><para>E. The Compact may be amended by the compact states. No amendment to the Compact shall become effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states.</para><para>ARTICLE XIV</para><para>CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</para><para>The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the Compact. If the Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state which is a member of the Compact, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2018, LB1034, &#167; 70. </para><effectivedate>July 19, 2018</effectivedate></source></law>
