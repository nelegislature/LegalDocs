RULEMAKING</para><para>A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact.

The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a Member State that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.</para><para>C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the Rule or amendment, whichever is later.</para><para>D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member State.</para><para>E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Compact Commission.</para><para>F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Compact Commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.</para><para>G.

The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;</para><para>4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and</para><para>5.

A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the Compact Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.</para><para>J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings required by this Section.</para><para>K. The Compact Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.</para><para>1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.</para><para>2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.</para><para>3. The Compact Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.</para><para>L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the Rule.

The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.</para><para>3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.

Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of the Member States' Licensing Authority.</para><para>E.

The terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination.</para><para>G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Compact Commission and the defaulting State.</para><para>H.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact statute.</para><para>a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Section 11 of this Compact.</para><para>b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the Compact, the Compact Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than seven.</para><para>2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 8(C)(21) of this Compact to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.</para><para>3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Compact Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.</para><para>4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.</para><para>B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</para><para>1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.</para><para>2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</para><para>3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.</para><para>C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.</para><para>D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.</para><para>SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</para><para>A. This Compact and the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.</para><para>B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</para><para>C.
