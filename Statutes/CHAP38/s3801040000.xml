The department may, along with other law enforcement agencies, investigate such reports or other complaints of unauthorized practice or unauthorized operation of a business. The director, with the recommendation of the appropriate board, may issue an order to cease and desist the unauthorized practice of such profession or unauthorized operation of such business as a measure to obtain compliance with the applicable credentialing requirements by the person or business prior to referral of the matter to the Attorney General for action. For businesses that do not have a board, the department may issue such cease and desist orders. Practice of such profession or operation of such business without a credential after receiving a cease and desist order is a Class III felony.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2007, LB463, &#167; 40; </para><para>Laws 2016, LB859, &#167; 1. </para></source></law>
