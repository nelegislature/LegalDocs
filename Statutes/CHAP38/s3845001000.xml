Qualified Immunity, Defense, and Indemnification</para><para>1.

RULEMAKING</para><para>A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact.

The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State's laws, regulations, and applicable standards that govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.</para><para>C.

A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.</para><para>J. Nothing in Section 12 of this Compact shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.

The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.</para><para>1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.</para><para>2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.</para><para>3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 12.L of this Compact, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.</para><para>L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with forty-eight hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in Section 12 of this Compact shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:</para><para>1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;</para><para>2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;</para><para>3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or rule; or</para><para>4.

The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.</para><para>3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.</para><para>B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination</para><para>1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State.

If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</para><para>D.

Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority, and each of the Member States' State Licensing Authority.</para><para>E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.</para><para>F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all Multistate Authorizations to Practice within that State granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of the notice of termination.</para><para>G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.</para><para>H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</para><para>I. Dispute Resolution</para><para>1.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact statute.</para><para>a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Section 13 of this Compact.</para><para>b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than seven.</para><para>2.

All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.</para><para>4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.</para><para>B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</para><para>1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.</para><para>2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</para><para>3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.

Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.</para><para>D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.</para><para>SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</para><para>A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, implementation, and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.</para><para>B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, of a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</para><para>C. Notwithstanding Section 15.B of this Compact, the Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 13.B of this Compact, terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.</para><para>SECTION 16. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS</para><para>A.
