The payment or delivery to any such beneficiary, beneficiaries, or designated person or a receipt or acquittance signed by any such beneficiary, beneficiaries, or designated person for any such payment or delivery shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge of the bank or association for the payment or delivery so made. No bank or association paying any such fiduciary, beneficiary, or designated person in accordance with this section shall thereby be liable for any estate, inheritance, or succession taxes which may be due this state.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 912, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 909, &#167; 2.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
