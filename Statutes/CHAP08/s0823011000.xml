period is extended, the out-of-state trust company may establish representative
trust offices only on prior written approval of the director.</para>

its safety or soundness, that the trust company does not have adequate fidelity
bond coverage, or that the proposed representative trust office would not
be in the public interest.</para>

subsection (2) of this section and does not act within ninety days, the out-of-state
trust company may, upon compliance with sections 8-209 and 8-210, establish
representative trust offices on the ninety-first day following the director's
