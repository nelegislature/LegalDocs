If the acquiring institution is a bank, it may continue to operate such financial institution in its original form notwithstanding its denomination as a bank subsidiary. Acquisitions by any financial institution under sections 8-1506 to 8-1510 or section 8-1516 shall be deemed to be of the same nature as an acquisition of a state-chartered bank and shall follow such rules or regulations as may be established by the Director of Banking and Finance for acquisition of state-chartered banks by a bank holding company.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1983, LB 241, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 239, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1990, LB 956, &#167; 13; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 456, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1275, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 1089, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 217, &#167; 26.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
