In all cases in which a similarity of names now exists, or may hereafter exist, a complaint may be made to the department. If in the judgment of the department a similarity does exist and creates confusion in conducting the business of either or both financial institutions, the department may by order require the financial institution which is junior in time in the use of its name in such city, village, or county to change or modify its name to prevent confusion. The change of name shall be approved by the department.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1909, c. 10, &#167; 31, p. 80; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 310; </para><para>Laws 1919, c. 190, tit.
