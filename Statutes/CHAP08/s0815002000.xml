forms provided by the department of such proposed acquisition.</para>
<para>The Director of Banking and Finance, upon receipt of such notice, shall
act upon it within thirty days, and, unless he or she disapproves the proposed
acquisition within that period of time, it may become effective on the sixty-first
day after receipt without his or her approval, except that the director may
extend the thirty-day period an additional thirty days if in his or her judgment
any material information submitted is substantially inaccurate or the acquiring
party has not furnished all the information required by sections 8-1501 to
8-1505 or by the director.</para>
<para>An acquisition may be made prior to the expiration of the disapproval
period if the director issues written notice of his or her intent not to disapprove
the action.</para>

acquisition, the director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of the
disapproval. The notice shall provide a statement of the basis for the disapproval.</para>
