and all property of the converted savings association, including its rights,
titles, and interests in and to all property of whatever kind, whether real,
personal, or mixed, things in action, and every right, privilege, interest,
and asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing, or pertaining
to it, or which would inure to it, immediately, by operation of law and without
any conveyance or transfer and without any further act or deed, shall vest
in and remain the property of such converted savings association, and the
same shall have, hold, and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to
the same extent as the same was possessed, held, and enjoyed by the converting
savings association.</para>

to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations, and relations of the converting
savings association.</para>
<para>(3) All pending actions and other judicial proceedings to which the
converting savings association is a party shall not be abated or discontinued
by reason of such conversion but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order,

such converted savings association may continue the actions in its new corporate
