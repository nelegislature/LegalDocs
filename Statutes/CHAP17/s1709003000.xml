Such bonds shall bear interest, payable annually or semiannually, and shall be payable any time the municipality may determine at the time of their issuance, but in not more than twenty years after their issuance. The city council or village board of trustees shall levy annually a sufficient tax to maintain, operate, and extend any system or plant and to provide for the payment of the interest on, and the principal of, any bonds that may have been issued as provided in this section.
