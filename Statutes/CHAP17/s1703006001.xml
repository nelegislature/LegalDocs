class. Thereafter such village shall become a city of the second class and

second class.</para><para>(5)
Upon such proclamation, the governing body of the city shall call a special
election for the purpose of electing new members of the city's governing body
to be held not more than eight months after the proclamation is issued. At

on the general election ballot. One-half or the bare majority of the candidates
in each precinct or ward or at-large candidates, as the case may be, receiving
the greatest number of votes at the general election, shall be elected to
terms of the longest duration, and those receiving the next greatest number
of votes shall be elected to the remaining term or terms. Thereafter all members
shall be nominated at the statewide primary election and elected at the statewide
general election for four-year terms as provided in section 32-533. The members

or modified by such city within one year after the date of the filing of the
certificate pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.</para>
