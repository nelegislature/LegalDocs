The amount of tax annually budgeted for this special fund shall not require a tax levy in excess of ten and five-tenths cents on each one hundred dollars upon the taxable value of all the taxable property in such city or village in any one year, and the additional levy shall be continued only for as many years as may be necessary to raise the total amount required for such purpose. Such assessments shall be refunded out of the special fund upon proper claims filed by the person or persons entitled to reimbursement. Such claim shall be audited, allowed, and ordered paid in the same manner as other claims against such city or village. All such reimbursements shall be made pro rata if there is not sufficient money on hand to repay them all at one time. Such amount of tax for the special fund shall be specified in the adopted budget statement.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1933, c. 30, &#167; 1, p. 209; </para><para>Laws 1937, c. 176, &#167; 6, p. 698; </para><para>Laws 1939, c. 12, &#167; 6, p. 85; </para><para>Laws 1941, c. 157, &#167; 21, p. 624; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 17-567; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 17-703; </para><para>Laws 1945, c. 28, &#167; 3, p. 141; </para><para>Laws 1945, c. 29, &#167; 3, p. 145; </para><para>Laws 1953, c. 287, &#167; 19, p. 941; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 145, &#167; 20, p. 685; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 187, &#167; 56; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 719A, &#167; 57; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB133, &#167; 218; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB317, &#167; 1. </para></source></law>
