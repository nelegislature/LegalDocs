The petitioners shall, within ten days after the filing of such petition, cause a copy of such petition to be served on such city or village in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in a civil action. If the city or village by a majority vote of all members of the city council or village board of trustees consents that such territory be disconnected, the court shall enter a decree disconnecting the territory, and in such case no costs shall be taxed against such city or village. In case such a city or village desires to contest such petition, it shall file its answer to such petition within thirty days after the service of a copy of the petition and upon such filing shall be joined to the issue and the cause shall be tried by the court as a suit in equity. If the court finds in favor of the petitioners and that justice and equity require that such territory, or any part thereof, be disconnected from such city or village, it shall enter a decree accordingly. In all cases such a decree disconnecting part or all of such territory shall particularly describe the territory affected and a certified copy of such decree shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds or county clerk of the county in which such territory is situated. A certified copy of such decree shall also be forwarded to and filed in the office of the affected city clerk or village clerk. Either party may prosecute an appeal from the finding and decree of the district court to the Court of Appeals.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1879, &#167; 101, p. 232; </para><para>Laws 1881, c. 23, &#167; 12, p. 192; </para><para>Laws 1901, c. 20, &#167; 1, p. 320; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 5090; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 4263; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 17-412; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 17-414; </para><para>Laws 1945, c. 27, &#167; 1, p. 138; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 732, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB133, &#167; 116. </para></source><annotation><para><emphasis>1.
