of the patrol having knowledge of a stolen vehicle shall immediately furnish
the department with full information in connection therewith. The department,
whenever it receives a report of the theft or conversion of such a vehicle,
whether owned in this or any other state, together with the make and manufacturer's
serial number or motor number, if applicable, shall make a distinctive record
thereof and file the same in the numerical order of the manufacturer's serial
number with the index records of such vehicle of such make. The department
shall prepare a report listing such vehicles stolen and recovered as disclosed
by the reports submitted to it, and the report shall be distributed as it
may deem advisable. In the event of the receipt from any county treasurer of a copy of a certificate
of title to such vehicle, the department shall immediately notify the rightful
owner thereof and the county treasurer who
issued such certificate of title, and if upon investigation it appears that
such certificate of title was improperly issued, the department shall immediately
cancel the same. In the event of the recovery of such stolen or converted
vehicle, the owner shall immediately notify the department, which shall cause
the record of the theft or conversion to be removed from its file.</para>
