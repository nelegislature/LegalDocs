Alternatives to incarceration should be considered in order to reduce the cost to the taxpayers, successfully rehabilitate offenders, ensure public safety, and minimize risk to society. Ignition interlock devices, which are required to be installed for those who are charged with or have been convicted of certain offenses, while effective, may be a financial burden to those who cannot afford the costs of installation or maintenance of such devices. In this state, ignition interlock devices have been proven to be an effective means of preventing drivers from operating motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol. Other states have implemented 24/7 sobriety programs. States that implement 24/7 sobriety programs have seen success with such programs in that participants have higher rates of maintaining sobriety, have lower rates of recidivism, are more likely to become productive members of society, and are less likely to be a continued public risk. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the State of Nebraska to establish 24/7 sobriety programs.</para><para>(2) A 24/7 sobriety program shall coordinate efforts among various state and local governmental agencies for finding and implementing alternatives to incarceration for offenses that involve operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2021, LB271, &#167; 2. </para><operativedate>July 1, 2022</operativedate></source></law>
