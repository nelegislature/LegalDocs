<para>Within ten days after the revocation provided for by section
60-4,169, the director shall notify in writing the person whose commercial
driver's license or privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle has been
revoked that such license or privilege has been revoked. Such notice shall:
(1) Contain a list of the disqualifying convictions or administrative determinations
upon which the director relies as his or her authority for the revocation,
with the dates on which such disqualifying violations occurred and the dates
of such convictions or administrative determinations and the trial courts
or administrative agencies in which such convictions or administrative determinations
were rendered; (2) state the term of revocation; (3) include a demand that
the commercial driver's license be returned to the director immediately; and
(4) be served by mailing the notice to such person by regular United States mail to the address of
such person. If any person fails to return a commercial driver's license following
a demand by the director, the director shall immediately direct any peace
officer or authorized representative of the director to secure possession
of such license and return the license to the director. Any person refusing
or failing to surrender a commercial driver's license as required by this
section shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class III misdemeanor.</para>
<para>Any person who feels himself or herself aggrieved because
of a revocation pursuant to section 60-4,169 may appeal from such revocation
in the manner set forth in section 60-4,105. Such appeal shall not suspend
the order of revocation unless a stay of such revocation shall be allowed
by the court pending a final determination of the review. The license of any
person claiming to be aggrieved shall not be restored to such person, in the
event of a final judgment of a court against such person, until the full time
of revocation, as fixed by the director, has elapsed.</para>
