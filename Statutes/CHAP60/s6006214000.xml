For there to be willful reckless driving it is not necessary that there be property damage or injury inflicted. Here, intentional or deliberate disregard for the safety or property of others was lacking, since there was no evidence of the presence of any persons or property subjected to danger in the area, and the defendant was only driving 36 m.p.h. in a 25-m.p.h. zone.
