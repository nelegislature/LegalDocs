Constitutionality</emphasis></para><para>A subsequent prosecution of driving while the operator's license was revoked, after defendant had already been convicted of willful reckless driving and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, did not violate the double jeopardy clause, because the State did not prove the entire conduct for which defendant had already been convicted. Willful reckless driving and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated are not lesser-included offenses of operating a motor vehicle while the operator's license was revoked, and a subsequent conviction of driving while the operator's license is revoked would not violate the Blockburger test.

Offense</emphasis></para><para>An ignition-interlock permitholder who drives a vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device may not be charged under this section and must be charged under section 60-6,211.05(5).

Portsche, 261 Neb. 160, 622 N.W.2d 582 (2001).</para><para>In a prosecution under this section (formerly subsection (6) of section 60-6,196) for driving when one's operator's license has been revoked pursuant to subdivision (2)(c) of this section, proof of the prior conviction under subdivision (2)(c) is an essential element of the offense, and thus, the State has the burden to prove the prior conviction. A prior third-offense drunk driving conviction may be used as an element of a violation under this section (formerly subsection (6) of section 60-6,196) even though the prior conviction is not subject to a collateral attack.

Testing/sufficiency of the evidence</emphasis></para><para>A certified copy from the Department of Motor Vehicles which shows that a defendant's operator's license was revoked is insufficient to show that the defendant either had counsel or waived counsel at the time he was convicted of the prior offense and is therefore insufficient to support a conviction under this section (formerly subsection (6) of section 60-6,196). State v. Watkins, 4 Neb. App. 356, 543 N.W.2d 470 (1996).</para><para><emphasis>4.
