If a discrepancy exists between the odometer reading and the actual mileage, a warning notice to alert the transferee shall be included with the statement. The transferor shall retain a true copy of such statement for a period of five years from the date of the transaction. Beginning on the implementation date designated by the director pursuant to subsection (2) of section 60-1508, if motor vehicle ownership has been transferred by operation of law pursuant to repossession under subdivision (2)(b)(iv) of section 60-166, the mileage shall be listed as the odometer reading at the time of the most recent transfer of ownership prior to the repossession of the motor vehicle. The adjustment shall not be deemed a violation of section 60-190.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2005, LB 276, &#167; 92; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB263, &#167; 22; </para><para>Laws 2018, LB909, &#167; 37. </para></source></law>
