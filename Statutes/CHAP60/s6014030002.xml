or the predecessor franchisee as a part of the franchisee's initial inventory
and (ii) in the case of a motorcycle franchise, the payment for such supplies,
parts, and accessories shall be based upon the currently published dealer
cost for all unused, undamaged, and unsold supplies, parts, and accessories

to convey that title to the franchisor. This
section shall not apply to a termination or noncontinuation of a franchise
that is implemented as a result of the sale of the assets or stock of the

<para>(3)(a) If the termination,
cancellation, or nonrenewal of a franchise is the result of the termination,
elimination, or cessation of a line-make by the manufacturer, distributor,

the franchise facilities for lease or sublease with a licensed real estate
agent within thirty days after the effective date of the termination of the
franchise and by reasonably cooperating with the real estate agent in the
performance of the agent's duties and responsibilities. If the franchisee
is able to lease or sublease the franchise facilities on terms that are consistent
with local zoning requirements to preserve the right to sell motor vehicles
from the franchise facilities and the terms of the franchisee's lease, the

from such mitigation, but only following receipt of franchise facilities assistance
payments pursuant to subdivision (3)(b) of this section and only up to the
