influence of alcoholic liquor or drugs; implied consent to submit to chemical
test; when test administered; refusal; advisement;
effect; violation; penalty.</catchline><para>(1) Any
person who operates or has in his or her actual physical control a motor vehicle
in this state shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to submit to
a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the concentration of alcohol or the presence of drugs in such
blood, breath, or urine.</para>
<para>(2) Any peace officer who has been duly authorized to make
arrests for violations of traffic laws of this state or of ordinances of any
city or village may require any person arrested for any offense arising out
of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving or was
in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcoholic liquor or drugs to submit to a chemical test or tests of his or
her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the concentration
of alcohol or the presence of drugs in such blood, breath, or urine when the
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that such person was driving or
was in the actual physical control of a motor vehicle in this state while
under the influence of alcoholic liquor or drugs in violation of section 60-6,196.</para>
<para>(3) Any person arrested as described in subsection (2) of
this section may, upon the direction of a peace officer, be required to submit
to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine for a determination
of the concentration of alcohol or the presence of drugs. If the chemical
test discloses the presence of a concentration of alcohol in violation of
subsection (1) of section 60-6,196, the person shall be subject to the administrative license revocation procedures
provided in sections 60-498.01 to 60-498.04 and upon conviction be punished as provided
in sections 60-6,197.02 to 60-6,197.08. Any person who refuses to submit to
such test or tests required pursuant to this section shall be subject to the
administrative license revocation
procedures provided in sections 60-498.01 to 60-498.04 and shall be guilty
of a crime and upon conviction punished as provided in sections 60-6,197.02
to 60-6,197.08.</para>
<para>(4) Any person involved in a motor vehicle accident in this
state may be required to submit to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine
by any peace officer if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that
the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
on a public highway in this state while under the influence of alcoholic liquor
or drugs at the time of the accident. A person involved in a motor vehicle
accident subject to the implied consent law of this state shall not be deemed
to have withdrawn consent to submit to a chemical test of his or her blood,
breath, or urine by reason of leaving this state. If the person refuses a
test under this section and leaves the state for any reason following an accident,
he or she shall remain subject to subsection (3) of this section and sections 60-498.01 to 60-498.04 upon
return.</para>
<para>(5) Any person who is required to submit to a chemical blood,
breath, or urine test or tests pursuant to this section shall be advised that
refusal to submit to such test or tests is a separate crime for which the
person may be charged. Failure
to provide such advisement shall not affect the admissibility of the chemical
test result in any legal proceedings. However, failure to provide such advisement
shall negate the state's ability to bring any criminal charges against a refusing
party pursuant to this section.</para>
<para>(6) Refusal to submit to a chemical blood, breath, or urine
test or tests pursuant to this section shall be admissible evidence in any
action for a violation of section 60-6,196 or a city or village ordinance
enacted in conformance with such section.</para>

Lowrey, 239 Neb. 343, 476 N.W.2d 540 (1991).</para><para>It is established that as a condition precedent to a valid request by an officer to submit to a chemical test under the implied consent law, the arresting officer must have "reasonable grounds" to believe that the licensee was either driving a motor vehicle or in actual physical control of same while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Larson v.

Advisement</emphasis></para><para>Under subsection (5) (formerly subsection (10) of this section), a person arrested for driving under the influence must be advised that refusal to submit to a chemical test is a separate crime for which the person may be charged, but he or she need not be advised of any additional consequences of a refusal to submit to a chemical test. State v. Turner, 263 Neb. 896, 644 N.W.2d 147 (2002).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (5) (formerly subsection (10) of this section), substantial compliance with the statute will suffice under certain circumstances. State v. Roucka, 253 Neb. 885, 573 N.W.2d 417 (1998).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (10) of this section (60-6,197 (Reissue 1993)), a driver-arrestee who is required to submit to a chemical blood, breath, or urine test under this section should be advised of the natural and direct legal consequence of submitting to a chemical test. Such consequences include that any incriminating results from such a test may be used against the person in a criminal proceeding. State v. Christner, 251 Neb. 549, 557 N.W.2d 707 (1997).</para><para>A sensible reading of subsection (10) of this section (60-6,197 (Reissue 1993)) indicates that the Legislature intended drivers to be advised of the natural and direct legal consequences flowing from submitting to a chemical blood, breath, or urine test and failing it.

Smith v. State, 248 Neb. 360, 535 N.W.2d 694 (1995).</para><para>One cannot evade the effect of this section simply by repeatedly screaming, while the implied consent form is read to him or her, that he or she does not understand. For purposes of enhancement, a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel may not be inferred from a defendant's pro se appearance at trial in a prior conviction. At a minimum, a sufficiently complete checklist or other docket entry may be used to establish a valid waiver of counsel as to prior convictions for enhancement purposes. State v. Green, 238 Neb. 328, 470 N.W.2d 736 (1991).</para><para>There is no requirement that Miranda warnings be given prior to a request to submit to a chemical analysis of blood, breath, or urine under the Nebraska implied consent law.

Refusal</emphasis></para><para>An arrested motorist refuses to submit to a chemical test when the motorist's conduct, demonstrated under the circumstances confronting the officer requesting the chemical test, justifies a reasonable person's belief that the motorist understood the officer's request for a test and manifested a refusal or unwillingness to submit to the requested test. Betterman v. Department of Motor Vehicles, 273 Neb. 178, 728 N.W.2d 570 (2007).</para><para>A refusal to submit to a chemical test occurs within the meaning of subsection (4) of this section when the licensee, after being asked to submit to a test, so conducts himself as to justify a reasonable person in the requesting officer's position in believing that the licensee understood that he was being asked to submit to a test and manifested an unwillingness to take it. State v. Beerbohm, 229 Neb. 439, 427 N.W.2d 75 (1988).</para><para>The choice of whether one's blood or urine shall be tested for determination of alcohol content belongs to the licensee; a licensee who, upon the request of a law enforcement officer to do so, refuses to specify which fluid he or she will produce for such testing has refused to submit to a chemical test in violation of subsection (4) of this section. State v. Beerbohm, 229 Neb. 439, 427 N.W.2d 75 (1988).</para><para>A person is not exempted from the provisions of the refusal statute merely because he was too intoxicated to take the test. State v. Medina, 227 Neb. 736, 419 N.W.2d 864 (1988).</para><para>Anything less than an unqualified, unequivocal assent to an officer's request to submit to a chemical test constitutes a refusal. State v. Medina, 227 Neb. 736, 419 N.W.2d 864 (1988); Clontz v. Jensen, 227 Neb. 191, 416 N.W.2d 577 (1987).</para><para>A refusal to submit to a chemical test occurs within the meaning of the implied consent law when the licensee, after being asked to submit to a test, so conducts himself as to justify a reasonable person in the requesting officer's position in believing that the licensee understood he was being asked to submit to a test and manifested an unwillingness to take it. Pollard v. Jensen, 222 Neb. 521, 384 N.W.2d 640 (1986).</para><para>Justifiable refusal to take a body fluids test depends on some illegal or unreasonable aspect of the request to submit, the test itself, or both. A conditional refusal is a refusal under Nebraska's implied consent law. A motor vehicle driver is not entitled to consult a lawyer before submitting to a body fluids test because the suspension of a driver's license which results from refusal is a remedial, not strictly punitive, measure. Bapat v. Jensen, 220 Neb. 763, 371 N.W.2d 742 (1985).</para><para>An operator has refused to submit to a test when he conducts himself in a way which would justify a reasonable person in believing that he understood he had been asked to take the test and manifested an unwillingness to take it. Bauer v. Peterson, 212 Neb. 174, 322 N.W.2d 389 (1982).</para><para>Single request for chemical test is sufficient, but more than one request may be permissible, and request need not be made at scene of arrest.

Sullivan, 190 Neb. 295, 207 N.W.2d 680 (1973).</para><para>A conditional or qualified refusal to take the test is a refusal to submit to the test within the meaning of the act. State v. Eckert, 186 Neb. 134, 181 N.W.2d 264 (1970).</para><para>Section does not sanction qualified or conditional consent; such a consent is in fact a refusal. Preston v.

Miscellaneous</emphasis></para><para>The "current violation" referred to in section 60-6,197.03(8) may be either a violation of the driving under the influence statute, section 60-6,196, or a violation of this section. State v. Wagner, 295 Neb. 132, 888 N.W.2d 357 (2016).</para><para>The elements of driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury are: (1) The defendant was operating a motor vehicle, (2) the defendant was operating a motor vehicle in violation of section 60-6,196 or this section, and (3) the defendant's act of driving under the influence proximately caused serious bodily injury to another person. State v. Irish, 292 Neb. 513, 873 N.W.2d 161 (2016).</para><para>The validity of a charge for refusing to submit to a chemical test under subsection (3) of this section depends upon the State's showing a valid arrest under subsection (2). If the arrest was invalid because the police officers lacked probable cause, a conviction for refusing to submit to a chemical test is invalid. State v. McCave, 282 Neb. 500, 805 N.W.2d 290 (2011).</para><para>The sworn report of the arresting officer must indicate (1) that the person was arrested as described in subsection (2) of this section and the reasons for the arrest, (2) that the person was requested to submit to the required test, and (3) that the person refused to submit to the required test. Nothnagel v. Neth, 276 Neb. 95, 752 N.W.2d 149 (2008).</para><para>A sentencing court, as part of its judgment of conviction under the implied consent law, in addition to ordering the convicted person not to drive any vehicle in the state for any purpose for 6 months, shall order that the operator's license of such person be revoked for a like period. The proscription that there can be no revocation of one's driver's license and operating privileges if the refusal to submit to a chemical test is reasonable under the circumstances contained in section 39-669.16 (transferred to section 60-498.02), relates only to administrative license revocations by the Director of Motor Vehicles. In a criminal proceeding, however, the inquiry centers on the existence of reasonable grounds for the arresting officer to believe that an operator was driving while under the influence of alcohol. State v. Boyd, 242 Neb. 144, 493 N.W.2d 344 (1992).</para><para>Subsection (4)(a) of this section and section 39-669.07(b) (transferred to section 60-6,196) require that the relevant periods of revocation of one's operator's license not run concurrently with any jail term imposed. Revocation of one's operator's license for a period of 180 days does not fulfill the requirement of subsection (4)(a) of this section that revocation be for a period of 6 months. State v. Contreras, 236 Neb. 455, 461 N.W.2d 562 (1990).</para><para>Where the elements of a crime defined by statute are set out in an information or complaint, it is sufficient; and if words appear in such information or complaint which might be stricken, leaving a crime sufficiently charged, and such words do not tend to negative any of the essential averments, they may be treated as surplusage and be entirely rejected. State v. Blankenfeld, 229 Neb. 411, 427 N.W.2d 65 (1988).</para><para>Officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant was under influence of alcohol when operating or in control of vehicle. Porter v. Jensen, 223 Neb. 438, 390 N.W.2d 511 (1986).</para><para>It is no defense that a licensee asked to submit to a chemical test under the implied consent law does not understand the consequences of refusal or is not able to make a reasoned judgment as to what course of action to take. Pollard v. Jensen, 222 Neb. 521, 384 N.W.2d 640 (1986).</para><para>Where no issue as to the propriety of an arrest is raised and the evidence of the preliminary breath test is relevant only for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause to require a driver to submit to a test of his blood, urine, or breath, the admissibility of the preliminary breath test is a matter of law and should therefore be admitted into evidence out of the presence of the jury. State v. Klingelhoefer, 222 Neb. 219, 382 N.W.2d 366 (1986).</para><para>A driver is not entitled to consult with an attorney before submitting to a chemical test under the implied consent law, nor is a delay in the test required due to a driver's request to consult with an attorney. Fulmer v. Jensen, 221 Neb. 582, 379 N.W.2d 736 (1986).</para><para>A delay in chemical testing is nonprejudicial unless it materially affects the results of the test. Jamros v. Jensen, 221 Neb. 426, 377 N.W.2d 119 (1985).</para><para>Under the Nebraska Implied Consent Law, an officer may provide more than one opportunity to acquire a sufficient breath sample, even though only one chance is necessary. Raymond v. Department of Motor Vehicles, 219 Neb. 821, 366 N.W.2d 758 (1985).</para><para>The trial court must advise a defendant charged with refusal to submit to a chemical test of the penalties for first, second, or third offense. However, when the defendant was charged with, advised of the penalty for, and convicted of first offense refusal, the failure to advise him of the penalties for repeat offenses was not error. State v. Tichota, 218 Neb. 444, 356 N.W.2d 85 (1984).</para><para>Only tests taken pursuant to class A or B permits are such a chemical test as to comport with the requirement of subsection (1) of this section and a chemical analysis as to comport with section 39-669.07 (transferred to section 60-6,196).
