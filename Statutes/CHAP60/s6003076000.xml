A sticker shall be displayed on the front and rear windows or the rear side windows of such motor vehicle, except an autocycle or a motorcycle, and displayed on the front and rear of each such trailer. On the sticker shall be plainly printed in black letters the words In Transit. One In Transit sticker shall be displayed on an autocycle or a motorcycle, which sticker may be one-half the size required for other motor vehicles. Such stickers shall include a registration number, which registration number shall be different for each sticker or pair of stickers issued, and the contents of such sticker and the numbering system shall be as prescribed by the department. Each dealer issuing such stickers shall keep a record of the registration number of each sticker or pair of stickers on the invoice of such sale. Such sticker shall allow such owner to operate the motor vehicle or tow such trailer for a period of thirty days in order to effect proper registration of the new or used motor vehicle or trailer. When any person, firm, or corporation has had a motor vehicle or trailer previously registered and license plates assigned to such person, firm, or corporation, such owner may operate the motor vehicle or tow such trailer for a period of thirty days in order to effect transfer of plates to the new or used motor vehicle or trailer.

Thus, such handwritten tags are not entitled to the presumption of compliance that we have afforded dealer-issued tags. The law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion to stop a motor vehicle when he or she sees such vehicle being operated on the public streets without license plates and without dealer-issued in-transit tags. Upon demand, the driver of such vehicle must show documents proving compliance with motor vehicle registration laws. State v. Kling, 8 Neb.
