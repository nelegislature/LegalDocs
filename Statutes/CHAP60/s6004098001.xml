Incomplete discovery shall not stay the hearing unless the petitioner requests a continuance. All proceedings before the hearing officer shall be recorded. Upon receipt of the arresting peace officer's sworn report, the director's order of revocation has prima facie validity and it becomes the petitioner's burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence grounds upon which the operator's license revocation should not take effect. The director shall make a determination of the issue within seven days after the conclusion of the hearing.
