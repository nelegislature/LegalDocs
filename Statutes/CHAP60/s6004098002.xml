<para>(1) At the expiration of fifteen days after the date of arrest
as described in subsection (2) of section 60-6,197 or if after a hearing pursuant
to section 60-498.01 the director finds that the operator's license should
be revoked, the director shall (a) revoke the operator's license of a person
arrested for refusal to submit to a chemical test of blood, breath, or urine
as required by section 60-6,197 for a period of one year and (b) revoke the
operator's license of a person who submits to a chemical test pursuant to
such section which discloses the presence of a concentration of alcohol specified
in section 60-6,196 for a period of one hundred eighty days unless the person's
driving record abstract maintained in the department's computerized records
shows one or more prior administrative license revocations on which final
orders have been issued during the immediately preceding fifteen-year period
at the time the order of revocation is issued, in which case the period of
revocation shall be one year. Except as otherwise provided in section 60-6,211.05,
a new operator's license shall not be issued to such person until the period
of revocation has elapsed. If the person subject to the revocation is a nonresident
of this state, the director shall revoke only the nonresident's operating
privilege as defined in section 60-474 of such person and shall immediately
forward the operator's license and a statement of the order of revocation
to the person's state of residence.</para>
<para>(2) A person operating a motor vehicle under an ignition
interlock permit issued pursuant to sections 60-498.01 to 60-498.04 who has
no previous convictions under section 60-6,196, 60-6,197, or 60-6,197.06 and
no previous administrative license revocation shall only operate the motor
vehicle to and from his or her residence for purposes of his or her employment,
his or her school, a substance abuse treatment program, his or her parole
or probation officer, his or her continuing health care or the continuing
health care of another person who is dependent upon the person, his or her
court-ordered community service responsibilities, or an ignition interlock
service facility. A person operating a motor vehicle under an ignition interlock
permit issued pursuant to sections 60-498.01 to 60-498.04 who has a previous
conviction under section 60-6,196, 60-6,197, or 60-6,197.06 or a previous
administrative license revocation shall only operate the motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device to
and from his or her residence, his or her place of employment, his or
her school, a
substance abuse treatment program,
or an ignition interlock service facility. Such permit shall indicate
for which purposes the permit may be used. All permits issued pursuant to
this subsection shall indicate that the permit is not valid for the operation
of any commercial motor vehicle.</para>

reinstated upon payment of a reinstatement fee as required by section 60-694.01.</para>
<para>(4)(a) A person whose operator's license is subject to revocation
pursuant to subsection (3) of section 60-498.01 shall have all proceedings
dismissed or his or her operator's license immediately reinstated without

director that:</para>

to file a complaint alleging a violation of section 60-6,196;</para>
<para>(ii) The defendant, after trial, was found not guilty of
violating section 60-6,196 or such charge was dismissed on the merits by the
court; or</para>
<para>(iii) In the criminal action on the charge of a violation
of section 60-6,196 arising from the same incident, the court held one of
the following:</para>
<para>(A) The peace officer did not have probable cause to believe
the person was operating or in the actual physical control of a motor vehicle
in violation of section 60-6,196 or a city or village ordinance enacted in
conformance with such section; or</para>
<para>(B) The person was not operating or in the actual physical
control of a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration in violation
of section 60-6,196 or a city or village ordinance enacted in conformance
with such section.</para>
<para>(b) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
establishing standards for the presentation of suitable evidence of compliance
with subdivision (a) of this subsection.</para>
<para>(c) If a criminal charge is filed or refiled for a violation
of section 60-6,196 pursuant to an arrest for which all administrative license
revocation proceedings were dismissed under this subsection, the director,
upon notification or discovery, may reinstate an administrative license revocation
under this section as of the date that the director receives notification
of the filing or refiling of the charge, except that a revocation shall not
be reinstated if it was dismissed pursuant to section 60-498.01.</para>

In a criminal proceeding, however, the inquiry centers on the existence of reasonable grounds for the arresting officer to believe that an operator was driving while under the influence of alcohol.
