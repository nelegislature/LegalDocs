power of Department of Roads; other than state highway system; power of local
authority; signs.</catchline><para>(1) Whenever the Department of Roads determines,
upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation, that any maximum
speed limit is greater or less than is reasonable or safe under the conditions
found to exist at any intersection, place, or part of the state highway system
outside of the corporate limits of cities and villages as well as inside the
corporate limits of cities and villages on freeways which are part of the
state highway system, it may determine and set a reasonable and safe maximum
speed limit for such intersection, place, or part of such highway which shall
be the lawful speed limit when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are
erected at such intersection, place, or part of the highway, except that the
maximum rural and freeway limits shall not be exceeded. Such a maximum speed
limit may be set to be effective at all times or at such times as are indicated
upon such signs.</para>
<para>(2) The speed limits set by the department shall not be a departmental
rule, regulation, or order subject to the statutory procedures for such rules,
regulations, or orders but shall be an authorization over the signature of
the Director-State Engineer and shall be maintained on permanent file at the
headquarters of the department. Certified copies of such authorizations shall
be available from the department at a reasonable cost for duplication. Any
change to such an authorization shall be made by a new authorization which
cancels the previous authorization and establishes the new limit, but the
new limit shall not become effective until signs showing the new limit are
erected as provided in subsection (1) of this section.</para>
<para>(3) On county highways which are not part of the state highway system
or within the limits of any state institution or any area under control of
the Game and Parks Commission or a natural resources district and which are
outside of the corporate limits of cities and villages, county boards shall
have the same power and duty to alter the maximum speed limits as the department
if the change is based on an engineering and traffic investigation comparable
to that made by the department. The limit outside of a business or residential
district shall not be decreased to less than thirty-five miles per hour.</para>
<para>(4) On all highways within their corporate limits, except on state-maintained
freeways which are part of the state highway system, incorporated cities and
villages shall have the same power and duty to alter the maximum speed limits
as the department if the change is based on engineering and traffic investigation,
except that no imposition of speed limits on highways which are part of the
state highway system in cities and villages under forty thousand inhabitants
shall be effective without the approval of the department.</para>
<para>(5) The director of any state institution, the Game and Parks Commission,
or a natural resources district, with regard to highways which are not a part
of the state highway system, which are within the limits of such institution
or area under Game and Parks Commission or natural resources district control,
and which are outside the limits of any incorporated city or village, shall
have the same power and duty to alter the maximum speed limits as the department
if the change is based on an engineering and traffic investigation comparable
to that made by the department.</para>
<para>(6) Not more than six such speed limits shall be set per mile along
a highway, except in the case of reduced limits at intersections. The difference between adjacent speed limits along a highway shall not be reduced by more than twenty miles per hour, and there shall be no limit on the difference
between adjacent speed limits for increasing speed limits along a highway.</para>
<para>(7) When the department or a local authority determines by an investigation
that certain vehicles in addition to those specified in sections 60-6,187,
60-6,305, and 60-6,313 cannot with safety travel at the speeds provided in
sections 60-6,186, 60-6,187, 60-6,189, 60-6,305, and 60-6,313 or set pursuant
to this section or section 60-6,188 or 60-6,189, the department or local authority
may restrict the speed limit for such vehicles on highways under its respective
jurisdiction and post proper and adequate signs.</para>
