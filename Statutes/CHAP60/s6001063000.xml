a certificate of title has been improperly issued, the department shall cancel
the same. Upon cancellation of any certificate of title, the department shall
notify the county treasurer who
issued the same, and such county treasurer shall
thereupon enter the cancellation upon his or her records. The department shall
also notify the person to whom such certificate of title was issued, as well
as any lienholders appearing thereon, of the cancellation and shall demand
the surrender of such certificate of title, but the cancellation shall not
affect the validity of any lien noted thereon. The holder of such certificate
of title shall return the same to the department forthwith.</para>

a certificate of title so canceled, the department shall immediately cancel
the same and demand the return of such certificate of registration and license
