The Department of Motor Vehicles shall review its records and the driving record abstract of any person who applies for an ignition interlock permit allowing operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device to determine (a) the applicant's eligibility for an ignition interlock permit, (b) the applicant's previous convictions under section 60-6,196, 60-6,197, or 60-6,197.06 or any previous administrative license revocation, if any, and (c) if the applicant is subject to any required no-drive periods before the ignition interlock permit may be issued.</para><para>(4)(a) If the court orders an ignition interlock device or the Board of Pardons orders an ignition interlock device under section 83-1,127.02, the court or the Board of Pardons shall order the defendant to apply for an ignition interlock permit as provided in section 60-4,118.06 which indicates that the defendant is only allowed to operate a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device.</para><para>(b) Such court order shall remain in effect for a period of time as determined by the court not to exceed the maximum term of revocation which the court could have imposed according to the nature of the violation and shall allow operation by the defendant of only an ignition-interlock-equipped motor vehicle.</para><para>(c) Such Board of Pardons order shall remain in effect for a period of time not to exceed any period of revocation the applicant is subject to at the time the application for a reprieve is made.</para><para>(5) Any person restricted to operating a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device, pursuant to a Board of Pardons order, who operates upon the highways of this state a motor vehicle without such device or if the device has been disabled, bypassed, or altered in any way, shall be punished as provided in subsection (3) of section 83-1,127.02.</para><para>(6) If a person ordered to use a continuous alcohol monitoring device and abstain from alcohol use pursuant to a court order as provided in subsection (2) of this section violates the provisions of such court order by removing, tampering with, or otherwise bypassing the continuous alcohol monitoring device or by consuming alcohol while required to use such device, he or she shall have his or her ignition interlock permit revoked and be unable to apply for reinstatement for the duration of the revocation period imposed by the court.</para><para>(7) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations regarding the approval of ignition interlock devices, the means of installing ignition interlock devices, and the means of administering the ignition interlock permit program.</para><para>(8)(a) The costs incurred in order to comply with the ignition interlock requirements of this section shall be paid directly to the ignition interlock provider by the person complying with an order for an ignition interlock permit and installation of an ignition interlock device.</para><para>(b) If the Department of Motor Vehicles has determined the person to be indigent and incapable of paying for the cost of installation, removal, or maintenance of the ignition interlock device in accordance with this section, such costs shall be paid out of the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund if such funds are available, according to rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department. Such costs shall also be paid out of the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund if such funds are available and if the court or the Board of Pardons, whichever is applicable, has determined the person to be indigent and incapable of paying for the cost of installation, removal, or maintenance of the ignition interlock device in accordance with this section.
