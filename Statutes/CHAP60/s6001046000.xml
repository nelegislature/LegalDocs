<para>(1) An application for a certificate of title for a vehicle shall include
a statement that an identification inspection has been conducted on the vehicle
unless (a) the title sought is a salvage branded certificate of title or a
nontransferable certificate of title, (b) the surrendered ownership document
is a Nebraska certificate of title, a manufacturer's statement of origin,
an importer's statement of origin, a United States Government Certificate
of Release of a vehicle, or a nontransferable certificate of title, (c) the
application contains a statement that the vehicle is to be registered under
section 60-3,198, (d) the vehicle is a cabin trailer, (e) the title sought
is the first title for the vehicle sold directly by the manufacturer of the
vehicle to a dealer franchised by the manufacturer, or (f) the vehicle was
sold at an auction authorized by the manufacturer and purchased by a dealer
franchised by the manufacturer of the vehicle.</para>
<para>(2) The department shall prescribe a form to be executed by a dealer
and submitted with an application for a certificate of title for vehicles
exempt from inspection pursuant to subdivision (1)(e) or (f) of this section.
The form shall clearly identify the vehicle and state under penalty of law
that the vehicle is exempt from inspection.</para>
<para>(3) The statement that an identification inspection has been conducted
shall be furnished by the county sheriff of any county or by any other holder
of a certificate of training issued pursuant to section 60-183, shall be in
a format as determined by the department, and shall expire ninety days after
the date of the inspection. The county treasurer shall
accept a certificate of inspection, approved by the superintendent, from an
officer of a state police agency of another state.</para>
<para>(4) The identification inspection shall include examination and notation
of the then current odometer reading, if any, and a comparison of the vehicle
identification number with the number listed on the ownership records, except
that if a lien is registered against a vehicle and recorded on the vehicle's
ownership records, the county treasurer shall
provide a copy of the ownership records for use in making such comparison.
If such numbers are not identical, if there is reason to believe further inspection
is necessary, or if the inspection is for a Nebraska assigned number, the
person performing the inspection shall make a further inspection of the vehicle
which may include, but shall not be limited to, examination of other identifying
numbers placed on the vehicle by the manufacturer and an inquiry into the
numbering system used by the state issuing such ownership records to determine
ownership of a vehicle. The identification inspection shall also include a
statement that the vehicle identification number has been checked for entry
in the National Crime Information Center and the Nebraska Crime Information
Service. In the case of an assembled vehicle, the identification inspection
shall include, but not be limited to, an examination of the records showing
the date of receipt and source of each major component part. No identification
inspection shall be conducted unless all major component parts are properly
attached to the vehicle in the correct location.</para>
<para>(5) If there is cause to believe that odometer fraud exists, written
notification shall be given to the office of the Attorney General. If after
such inspection the sheriff or his or her designee determines that the vehicle
is not the vehicle described by the ownership records, no statement shall
be issued.</para>
<para>(6) The county treasurer
or the department may also request an
identification inspection of a vehicle to determine if it meets the definition
of motor vehicle as defined in section 60-123.</para>
