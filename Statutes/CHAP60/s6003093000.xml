vehicles or trailers required to be registered under the Motor Vehicle Registration
Act may register all such motor vehicles or trailers on a calendar-year basis
or on an annual basis for the same registration period beginning in a month
chosen by the owner. When electing to establish the same registration period
for all such motor vehicles or trailers, the owner shall pay the registration
fee, the motor vehicle tax imposed in section 60-3,185, the motor vehicle fee imposed in section
60-3,190, and the alternative
fuel fee imposed in section 60-3,191 on each motor vehicle for
the number of months necessary to extend its current registration period to
the registration period under which all such motor vehicles or trailers will
be registered. Credit shall be given for registration paid on each motor vehicle
or trailer when the motor vehicle or trailer has a later expiration date than
that chosen by the owner except as otherwise provided in sections 60-3,121,
60-3,122.02, and 60-3,128. Thereafter all such motor vehicles or trailers
shall be registered on an annual basis starting in the month chosen by the
owner.</para>
