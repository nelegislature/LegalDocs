<para>(d) The licensee has made or caused to be made, in any document filed
with the director or in any proceeding under the act, any statement which

for any fines which may be levied against the licensee or any of its officers,
directors, shareholders, partners, or members pursuant to section 45-743 for
acts committed before the surrender. The director's approval of such license

pursuant to this section.</para>
<para>(4)(a) If a licensee fails to (i) renew its license as required by sections

before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, or expiration.</para>
