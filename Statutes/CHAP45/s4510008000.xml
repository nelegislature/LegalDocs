Installment Loan Act, the payment of the license fee, and the approval of
the required bond, the director shall investigate the facts regarding the
applicant. If the director finds that (1) the experience, character, and general
fitness of the applicant, of the applicant's partners or members if the applicant
is a partnership, limited liability company, or association, and of the applicant's
officers and directors if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant
belief that the applicant will operate the business honestly, fairly, and
efficiently within the purposes of the act, and (2) allowing the applicant
to engage in business will promote the convenience and advantage of the community
in which the business of the applicant is to be conducted, the department
shall issue and deliver an original license to the applicant to make loans
at the location specified in the application, in accordance with the act.
The license shall remain in full force and effect until the following December 31 and from year to year thereafter,
if and when renewed under the act, until it is surrendered by the licensee
or canceled, suspended, or revoked under the act.</para>
