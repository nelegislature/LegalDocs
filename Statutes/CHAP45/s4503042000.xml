The licensee may round the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1965, c. 268, &#167; 9, p. 762; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 478, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 279, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 214, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 269, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2004, LB 999, &#167; 34. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
