An action may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney General and the director, to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation. In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers, documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the act through or by means of the use of such property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, has such powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from time to time, be conferred upon the receiver by the court.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1943, c. 107, &#167; 8, p. 374; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 45-157; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1998), &#167; 45-157; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 53, &#167; 69. </para></source><annotation><para>Imposition of civil penalty is recognized.
