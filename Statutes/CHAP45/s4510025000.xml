authorized; loan period; violation; effect.</catchline><para>(1) Licensees
may charge, contract for, or receive any amount or rate of interest permitted
by section 45-101.03, 45-101.04, or 45-1024 upon any loan or upon any part
or all of any aggregate indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided
in subsection (2) of this section, the charging, contracting for, or receiving
of a rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.04 does not exempt the licensee
from compliance with the Nebraska Installment Loan Act.</para>
<para>(2)(a) Loans made by a licensee pursuant to subdivision (4) of section
45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska Installment Loan Act if such loans
are not made on real property.</para>
<para>(b) Loans made by a licensee pursuant to subdivision (11) of section
45-101.04 on real property are not subject to
the Nebraska Installment Loan Act. A licensee making such loans shall comply
with and be subject to the Residential
Mortgage Licensing Act with respect to such loans, except that
the licensee shall not be required to obtain a mortgage banker license under the Residential Mortgage Licensing
Act.</para>
<para>(c) Any mortgage loan
originator who works as an employee or independent agent of a licensee shall
be required to obtain a mortgage loan originator license and shall be subject
to the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.</para><para>(3) Except
as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 45-1024, no licensee shall enter
into any loan contract under the Nebraska Installment Loan Act under which
the borrower agrees to make any payment of principal more than thirty-six
calendar months from the date of making such contract when the principal balance
is not more than three thousand dollars. Every loan contract precomputed pursuant
to subsection (2) of section 45-1024 shall provide for repayment of principal
and charges in installments which shall be payable at approximately equal
periodic intervals of time and so arranged that no installment is substantially
greater in amount than any preceding installment. When necessary in order
to facilitate payment in accordance with the borrower's principal source of
income or when the loan contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection
(2) of section 45-1024, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment
payments. Any loan contract made in violation of this section, either knowingly
or without the exercise of due care to prevent the violation, shall not on
that account be void, but the licensee has no right to collect or receive
any interest or charges on such loan. If any interest or other charges have
been collected or contracted for, the licensee shall refund to the borrower
all interest and other charges collected and shall not collect thereafter
any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan
involved, as liquidated damages, and the licensee or its assignee, if found
liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including reasonable
attorney's fees. No licensee shall be found liable under this subsection if
the licensee shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was
not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance
of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid any such error.</para>
