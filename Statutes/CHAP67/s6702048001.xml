If the restated certificate restates and integrates and also further amends in any respect the certificate of limited partnership as amended or supplemented, it shall be specifically designated in its heading as an Amended and Restated Certificate of Limited Partnership together with such other words as the partnership may deem appropriate and shall be executed by at least one general partner and by each other general partner designated in the amended and restated certificate of limited partnership as a new general partner and filed as provided in section 67-245.</para><para>(c) A restated certificate of limited partnership shall state, either in its heading or in an introductory paragraph, the limited partnership's present name, the name under which it was originally filed if it has been changed, the date of filing of its original certificate of limited partnership with the Secretary of State, and the future effective date, which shall be a date certain, of the restated certificate if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the restated certificate. A restated certificate shall also state that it was duly executed and is being filed in accordance with this section.
