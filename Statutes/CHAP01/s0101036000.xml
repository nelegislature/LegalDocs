<para>(2)(a) Except as provided in the case of permits subject to subdivision
(2)(b) of this section, the board shall charge an annual permit fee as established
by the board not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars. All permits subject
to this subdivision shall expire on June 30 of each year and may be renewed
annually for a period of one year by certificate holders and registrants in
good standing upon payment of an annual renewal fee as established by the
board not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars. The board may prorate the fee
for any permit subject to this subdivision issued for less than one year.</para>
<para>(b) The board shall charge a biennial permit fee as established by the
board not to exceed three hundred dollars for permits issued under subdivision (1)(a) of this section. All permits
subject to this subdivision shall expire on June 30 of the first calendar
year after the calendar year of issuance in which the age of the certificate

<para>(3) Failure of a certificate holder or registrant to apply for a permit
within (a) three years from the expiration date of the permit last obtained
or renewed or (b) three years from the date upon which the certificate holder
or registrant was issued a certificate or registration if no permit was ever
issued to such person shall deprive him or her of the right to issuance or
renewal of a permit unless the board, in its discretion, determines such failure
to have been excusable. In such case the renewal fee or the fee for the issuance
of the original permit, as the case may be, shall be such amount as established
by the board not to exceed three hundred dollars.</para>
<para>(4) Any certificate holder or registrant who has not lost his or her
right to issuance or renewal of a permit and who is not actively engaged in
the practice of public accountancy in this state may file a written application
with the board to be classified as inactive. A person so classified shall
not be issued a permit or be deemed the holder of a permit but shall be carried
upon an inactive roll to be maintained by the board upon the payment of an
inactive fee as established by the board not to exceed fifty percent of the
fee charged persons actively engaged in the practice of public accountancy
as provided in this section. A person so classified shall not be deprived
of the right to the issuance or renewal of a permit and may, upon application
to the board and upon payment of the current permit fee, be issued a current
permit.</para>
