The Adjutant General may devise and change a formula to distribute incentive payments to members of the Nebraska Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, so as to encourage enlistments, reenlistments, or both, subject to the following restrictions. The payments shall be restricted to enlisted persons who have less than twelve years of total military service. The payments shall not exceed the rate of one hundred dollars per year of service but may be provided in advance of service, except that not more than three hundred dollars shall be paid in advance of performed service to any one individual at any time.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1978, LB 564, &#167; 4. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
