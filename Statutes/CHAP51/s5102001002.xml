The Legislature further finds that an educated and culturally aware society is increasingly important in an economy in which Nebraskans must compete on a global scale. It is the intent of the Legislature that Nebraskans will help lead the nation into the world of the twenty-first century.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 250, &#167; 9. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
