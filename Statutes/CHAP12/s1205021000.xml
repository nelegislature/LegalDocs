If the trustees deem it prudent and for the best interests of the association that all or a portion of its real estate be given to another nonprofit entity organized solely for educational, charitable, historic, conservation, or religious purposes or to the State of Nebraska rather than being sold, the district court may authorize such conveyance after such compliance with the provisions of sections 12-522 to 12-529 as the court shall deem applicable.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1907, c. 27, &#167; 1, p. 146; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 688; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 597; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 13-510; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 12-521; </para><para>Laws 1974, LB 645, &#167; 1.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
