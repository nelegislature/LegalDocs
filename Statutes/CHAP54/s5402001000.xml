When any person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company
not provided for in subsection (2) of this section procures, contracts with,
or hires any other person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability
company to feed and take care of any kind of livestock, the person, firm,
corporation, partnership, or limited liability company so procured, contracted
with, or hired shall have a first, paramount, and prior lien upon such livestock
for the feed and care furnished for the contract price agreed upon or, in
case no price has been agreed upon, for the reasonable value of such feed
and care, as long as the holders of any prior liens shall have agreed in writing
to the contract for the feed and care of the livestock involved. A lien created
under this subsection shall be treated in all respects as an agricultural
lien as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and may be enforced
in the manner and form provided for the enforcement of secured transactions
as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code. A lien created under this
subsection shall be perfected as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial
Code. Any financing statement filed to perfect such lien shall be filed prior
to removal of such livestock from the premises of the person, firm, corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company entitled to a lien and shall contain
or have attached thereto (a) the name and address and the social security
number or federal tax identification number of the person, firm, corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company claiming the lien, (b) the name
and address and the social security number or federal tax identification number,
if known, of the person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability
company for whom the feeding and care were furnished, (c) a description of
the livestock fed and furnished care, and (d) the amount justly due for the
feeding and care. The failure to include the social security number or federal
tax identification number shall not render any filing unperfected. At the
time the lien is filed, the lienholder shall send a copy to the person, firm,
corporation, partnership, or limited liability company for whom the feeding
and care were furnished. The fee for filing, amending, or releasing such lien
shall be the same as set forth in section 9-525, Uniform Commercial Code.</para>
<para>(2) When any person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability
company whose residence or principal place of business is located outside
the State of Nebraska procures, contracts with, or hires any other person,
firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company within the State
of Nebraska to feed and take care of any kind of livestock, the person, firm,
corporation, partnership, or limited liability company so procured, contracted
with, or hired shall have a first, paramount, and prior lien upon such livestock
for the feed and care furnished for the contract price agreed upon or, in
case no price has been agreed upon, for the reasonable value of such feed
and care. A lien created under this subsection shall be treated in all respects
as an agricultural lien as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code,
and may be enforced in the manner and form provided for the enforcement of
secured transactions as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial Code. A
lien created under this subsection shall be perfected as provided in article
9, Uniform Commercial Code. Any financing statement filed to perfect such
lien shall be filed prior to removal of such livestock from the premises of
the person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company entitled
to a lien and shall contain or have attached thereto (a) the name and address
and the social security number or federal tax identification number of the
person, firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company claiming
the lien, (b) the name and address and the social security number or federal
tax identification number, if known, of the person, firm, corporation, partnership,
or limited liability company for whom the feeding and care were furnished,
(c) a description of the livestock fed and furnished care, and (d) the amount
justly due for the feeding and care. The failure to include the social security
number or federal tax identification number shall not render any filing unperfected.
At the time the lien is filed, the lienholder shall send a copy to the person,
firm, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company for whom the
feeding and care were furnished. The fee for filing, amending, or releasing
such lien shall be the same as set forth in section 9-525, Uniform Commercial
Code.</para>
