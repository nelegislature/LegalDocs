motion, whenever it has reason to believe the Livestock Auction Market Act
has been violated, or upon verified complaint of any person in writing, investigate
the actions of any market license holder, and if the department finds probable
cause to do so, shall file a complaint against the market license holder which

notice served upon such market license holder either by personal service upon
him or her or by registered or certified mail prior to such hearing.</para>
<para>(2) The director shall have the power to administer oaths,
certify to all official acts, and subpoena any person in this state as a witness,
to compel the producing of books and papers, and to take the testimony of
any person on deposition in the same manner as is prescribed by law in the
procedure before the courts of this state in civil cases. Processes issued
by the director shall extend to all parts of the state and may be served by
any person authorized to serve processes. Each witness who shall appear by

amount shall be paid by the party at whose request such witness is subpoenaed.

Market Act, or (d) has violated any of the rules or regulations adopted and
