when.</catchline><para>(1) All brand inspections provided for in
the Livestock Brand Act or section 54-415 shall be from sunrise to sundown
or during such other hours and under such conditions as the Nebraska Brand
Committee determines.</para>
<para>(2)(a) An inspection fee, established by the Nebraska Brand
Committee, of not more than seventy-five cents per head shall be charged for
all cattle inspected in accordance with the Livestock Brand Act or section
54-415 or inspected within the brand inspection area or brand inspection service area by court order
or at the request of any bank, credit agency, or lending institution with
a legal or financial interest in such cattle. Such fee may vary to encourage
inspection to be performed at times and locations that reduce the cost of
performing the inspection but shall otherwise be uniform. The inspection fee
for court-ordered inspections shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale
of such cattle if ordered by the court or by either party as the court directs.
For other inspections, the person requesting the inspection of such cattle
is responsible for the inspection fee. Brand
inspections requested by either a purchaser or seller of cattle located within
the brand inspection service area shall be provided upon the same terms and
charges as brand inspections performed within the brand inspection area. If
estray cattle are identified as a result of the inspection, such cattle shall
be processed in the manner provided by section 54-415.</para>
<para>(b) A surcharge of not more than twenty dollars, as established
by the brand committee, may be charged to cover travel expenses incurred by
the brand inspector per inspection location when performing brand inspections.
The surcharge shall be collected by the brand inspector and paid by the person
requesting the inspection or the person required by law to have the inspection.</para>
<para>(c) Fees for
inspections performed outside of the brand inspection area that are not provided
for in subdivision (a) of this subsection shall be the inspection fee established
in such subdivision plus a fee to cover the actual expense of performing the
inspection, including mileage at the rate established by the Department of
Administrative Services and an hourly rate, not to exceed thirty dollars per
hour, for the travel and inspection time incurred by the brand committee to
perform such inspection. The brand committee shall charge and collect the
actual expense fee. Such fee shall apply to inspections performed outside
the brand inspection area as part of an investigation into known or alleged
violations of the Livestock Brand Act and shall be charged against the person
committing the violation.</para><para>(3) Any person
who has reason to believe that cattle were shipped erroneously due to an inspection
error during a brand inspection may request a reinspection. The person making
such request shall be responsible for the expenses incurred as a result of
the reinspection unless the results of the reinspection substantiate the claim
of inspection error, in which case the brand committee shall be responsible
for the reinspection expenses.</para>
