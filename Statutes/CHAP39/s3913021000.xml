Without limiting the same hereby, this may be done where uneconomic remnants of land would be left the original owner or where severance or consequential damages to a remainder make the acquisition of the entire parcel more economical to the state; <emphasis type="italic">Provided,</emphasis> that when any such property or land is left without access to a road, and the cost of acquisition of such landlocked property or land through the exercise of eminent domain would be more economical to the state than the cost of providing a means of reasonable ingress to or egress from the property or land, the state may, in its discretion, acquire such landlocked property or land thereof by eminent domain.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1955, c. 148, &#167; 21, p. 427; </para><para>Laws 1961, c. 181, &#167; 6, p. 538. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
