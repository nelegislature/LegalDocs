A water impoundment structure which will also serve as a roadbed may be approved and constructed only if the structure would contain the runoff from a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour frequency storm without water overtopping such structure or being discharged through its emergency spillway, except that if the road which is subject to such inundation is classified as a local road or remote residential road with current average daily traffic of fifty vehicles or less, the containment of a ten-year, twenty-four-hour frequency storm shall be sufficient. In making the storm frequency determinations required by this section, any recognized method may be used.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1979, LB 265, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 903, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2008, LB1068, &#167;  3.</para></source>  </law></legaldoc>
