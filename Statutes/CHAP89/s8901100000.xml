All fees and reimbursements collected pursuant to the act and credited to the fund shall be appropriated to the uses of the department to aid in defraying the expenses of administering the act, except that transfers may be made from the fund to the General Fund at the direction of the Legislature.

The director may sue for such fees and reimbursements and may seek to foreclose on any lien in the name of the state. The county attorney of the county in which the device is located or the Attorney General's office shall, upon the request of the director, take appropriate action to establish and foreclose on any such lien.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1972, LB 1413, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 1974, LB 17, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 258, &#167; 45; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 356, &#167; 30; </para><para>Laws 1994, LB 1066, &#167; 142; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 541, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 161, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 2009, First Spec.
