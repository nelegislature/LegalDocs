Subject to the limits in section 77-3442, the all-purpose levy shall not exceed an annual levy of eighty-seven and five-tenths cents on each one hundred dollars for cities of the first class and one dollar and five cents on each one hundred dollars for cities of the second class and villages upon the taxable valuation of all the taxable property in such city or village. Otherwise authorized extraordinary levies to service and pay bonded indebtedness of such municipalities may be made by such municipalities in addition to such all-purpose levy.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1957, c. 47, &#167; 1, p. 227; </para><para>Laws 1959, c. 67, &#167; 1, p. 293; </para><para>Laws 1965, c. 83, &#167; 1, p. 322; </para><para>Laws 1967, c. 96, &#167; 1, p. 293; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 845, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1972, LB 1143, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 187, &#167; 81; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 719A, &#167; 81; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1114, &#167; 35. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
