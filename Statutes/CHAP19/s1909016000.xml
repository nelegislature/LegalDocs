The proprietor or proprietors of any land within the corporate limits of any city of the first class, city of the second class, or village, or of any land contiguous or adjacent to the corporate limits of such city or village, may lay out such land into lots, blocks, streets, avenues, alleys, and other grounds under the name of .......... Addition to the City or Village of .........., and shall cause an accurate map or plat thereof to be made out, designating explicitly the land so laid out and particularly describing the lots, blocks, streets, avenues, alleys, and other grounds belonging to such addition. The lots shall be designated by numbers, and streets, avenues, and other grounds, by names or numbers. Such plat shall be acknowledged before some officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of deeds, shall contain a dedication of the streets, alleys, and public grounds therein to the use and benefit of the public, and shall have appended a survey made by some competent surveyor with a certificate attached, certifying that he or she has accurately surveyed such addition and that the lots, blocks, streets, avenues, alleys, parks, commons, and other grounds are well and accurately staked off and marked.

If the city council or village board of trustees includes the addition within the corporate limits, such map or plat shall be equivalent to a deed in fee simple absolute to the municipality from the proprietor of all streets, avenues, alleys, public squares, parks, and commons, and of such portion of the land as is therein set apart for public and municipal use, or is dedicated to charitable, religious, or educational purposes.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1901, c. 18, &#167; 6, p. 228; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 4811; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 3979; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 16-108; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 16-112; </para><para>Laws 1967, c. 66, &#167; 1, p. 215; </para><para>Laws 1974, LB 757, &#167; 3; </para><para>R.R.S.1943, &#167; 16-112; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 410, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 71, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 210, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 2009, LB495, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 2019, LB193, &#167; 83. </para></source><annotation><para>Annexation by city council resolution in compliance with a subdivision ordinance adopted by the city under section 19-916 constitutes a declaration of boundaries of the city by ordinance within the meaning of former section 79-801.
