The costs made by any such appeal or appeals shall be adjudged against the party defeated in such appeal in the same degree and manner as is done under the general court practice relating to appellate proceedings.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1919, c. 188, &#167; 6, p. 426; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 4605; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 19-706; </para><para>Laws 1941, c. 26, &#167; 6, p. 126; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 19-713; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 19-706; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 204, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 2019, LB193, &#167; 62. </para></source></law>
