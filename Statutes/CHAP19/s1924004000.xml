A copy of such resolution shall be published one time in a legal newspaper in or of general circulation in the city or village. After the fixed date such future installments shall be deemed to be delinquent and the city or village may proceed to enforce and collect the total amount due including all future installments.</para><para>(2) If the city or village incurs no new indebtedness pursuant to section 19-2405 for any water service extension or sanitary sewer extension in a district, the special assessments for such improvements shall be levied at one time and shall become delinquent in equal annual installments over such period of years as the city council or village board of trustees determines at the time of making the levy to be reasonable and fair.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1961, c. 63, &#167; 3, p. 249; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 51, &#167; 76, p. 322; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 655, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 933, &#167; 23; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 167, &#167; 24; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 960, &#167; 16; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 161, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 2015, LB361, &#167; 43; </para><para>Laws 2019, LB193, &#167; 145. </para></source></law>
