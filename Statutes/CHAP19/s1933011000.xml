Except as otherwise provided in any home rule charter, the grant of power in this section does not include power to engage, directly or indirectly, in the sale of gasoline, oil, or other merchandise or in furnishing of any service other than of parking motor vehicles as provided in the act. Any such city shall have the authority to acquire by grant, contract, or purchase, or through condemnation, as provided by law or by any home rule charter for such acquisition, all real or personal property, including a site or sites on which to construct such offstreet parking facility, necessary or convenient in carrying out of this grant of power. Property now used or hereafter acquired for public offstreet motor vehicle parking by a private operator in such cities shall not be subject to condemnation. Before any such city may commence a program to construct, purchase, or acquire by other means a proposed offstreet parking facility or facilities, notice shall be given, by publication once each week for not less than thirty days, inviting application for private ownership and operation of offstreet parking facilities, which notice shall fix a date for a public hearing on any application received. If no application or applications have been received or if received, the same have been disapproved by the city council of such city after a public hearing concerning such applications, then such city may proceed in the exercise of the powers granted in this section. The procedure to condemn property shall be exercised in the manner set forth in sections 76-701 to 76-724, except as to properties specifically excluded by section 76-703, and as to which sections 19-701 to 19-707 are applicable.
