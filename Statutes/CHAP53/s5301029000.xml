For craft brewery licenses, up to five separate physical locations may be described in each license. After such license has been granted for particular premises, the commission, with the approval of the local governing body and upon proper showing, may endorse upon the license permission to add to, delete from, or abandon the premises described in such license and, if applicable, to move from the premises to other premises approved by it, but in order to obtain such approval the retail, bottle club, craft brewery, or microdistillery licensee shall file with the local governing body a request in writing and a statement under oath which shows that the premises as added to or deleted from or to which such move is to be made comply in all respects with the requirements of the act. No such addition, deletion, or move shall be made by any such licensee until the license has been endorsed to that effect in writing by the local governing body and by the commission and the licensee furnishes proof of payment of the renewal fee prescribed in subsection (4) of section 53-131.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1935, c. 116, &#167; 49, p. 405; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 53-349; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 53-129; </para><para>Laws 1978, LB 386, &#167; 5; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 848, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 213, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 1089, &#167; 12; </para><para>Laws 1989, LB 781, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 183, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 1994, LB 1292, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 267, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 2004, LB 485, &#167; 19; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB549, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2010, LB861, &#167; 63; </para><para>Laws 2016, LB1105, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 2018, LB1120, &#167; 13. </para></source><annotation><para>If a named licensee desires to relocate the license, the licensee may do so under the provisions of this section by making application to either the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission or the local governing body.
