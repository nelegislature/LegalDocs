In determining the amount of the reimbursement reduction, the department shall consider:</para><para>(a) The extent of and reasons for noncompliance;</para><para>(b) The likely environmental impact of the noncompliance; and</para><para>(c) Whether noncompliance was negligent, knowing, or willful.</para><para>(6) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the department shall notify the responsible person of its approval or denial of the remedial action plan within one hundred twenty days after receipt of a remedial action plan which contains all the required information. If after one hundred twenty days the department fails to either deny, approve, or amend the remedial action plan submitted, the proposed plan shall be deemed approved.
