The Legislature further recognizes that a fuel crisis is pending in the nation and that the development of an additional source of fuel will provide an energy and environmental benefit to the citizens of this state and to the future economic growth of Nebraska.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1993, LB 364, &#167; 3. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
