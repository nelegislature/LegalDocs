If the quantity specified in the bill of lading, invoice, or shipping document is listed in units other than gallons, the wholesaler, supplier, or importer shall convert those units to gallons, using conversion tables approved by the council, prior to remitting the fee to the council.</para><para>Fee payments shall be remitted to the council on a regular basis as established by the council.
