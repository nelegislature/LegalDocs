term or condition of service; when effective.</catchline><para>(1)
The provisions of this section do not apply to general rate filings.</para>
<para>(2) Unless the commission otherwise orders, no jurisdictional
utility shall make effective any changed rate or any term or condition of
service pertaining to the service or rates of such utility, except by filing
the same with the commission at least thirty days prior to the proposed effective
date. The commission, for good cause, may allow such changed rate or any term
or condition of service pertaining to the service or rates of any such utility,
to become effective on less than thirty days' notice. If the commission allows
a change to become effective on less than thirty days' notice, the effective
date of the allowed change shall be the date established in the commission
order approving such change or the date of the order if no effective date
is otherwise established. Any such proposed change shall be shown by filing
with the commission a schedule showing the changes, and such changes shall
be plainly indicated by proper reference marks in amendments or supplements
to existing tariffs, schedules, or classifications, or in new issues thereof.</para>
<para>(3) Whenever any jurisdictional utility files with the commission
the changes desired to be made and put in force by such utility, the commission,
either upon complaint or upon its own motion, may give notice and hold a hearing
upon such proposed changes. Pending such hearing, the commission may suspend
the operation of such change and defer the effective date of such change in
rate or any term or condition of service pertaining to the service or rates
of any such utility, by delivering to such utility a statement in writing
of its reasons for such suspension. The
commission may not suspend a tariff filed pursuant to section 66-1868.</para>
<para>(4) The commission shall not delay the effective date of
the proposed change in rate or any term or condition of service pertaining
to the service or rates of any such jurisdictional utility, more than one
hundred eighty days beyond the date the utility filed its application requesting
the proposed change. If the commission does not suspend the proposed change
within thirty days after the date the same is filed by the utility, such proposed
change shall be deemed approved by the commission and shall take effect on
the proposed effective date. If the commission has not issued a final order
on the proposed change in any rate or any term or condition of service pertaining
to the service or rates of any such utility, within one hundred eighty days
after the date the utility files its application requesting the proposed change,
then the proposed change shall be deemed approved by the commission and the
proposed change shall be effective immediately, except that (a) in any proceeding
initiated as a result of a filing by a utility of new or changed rates or
terms and conditions of service, the commission shall, within thirty days
of the receipt of such filing, review the applications, documents, and submissions
made with such filing to determine whether or not they conform to the minimum
requirements of the commission regarding such filings as established by applicable
rule, regulation, or commission order. If such applications, documents, or
submissions fail to substantially conform with such requirements, they will
be deemed defective and the filing shall not be deemed to have been made until
such applications, documents, and submissions are determined to be in conformity
by the commission with minimum standards, and (b) nothing in this subsection
shall preclude the jurisdictional utility and the commission from agreeing
to a waiver or an extension of the one-hundred-eighty-day period.</para>
<para>(5) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section,
no change shall be made in any rate or in any term or condition of service
pertaining to the service or rates of any such jurisdictional utility, without
the consent of the commission. Within thirty days after such changes have
been authorized by the commission or become effective as provided in subsection
(4) of this section, copies of all tariffs, schedules, and classifications,
and all terms or conditions of service, except those determined to be confidential
under rules and regulations adopted by the commission, shall be available
for public inspection in every office and facility open to the general public
of such jurisdictional utility in this state.</para>
<para>(6) Except as to the time limits prescribed in subsection
(4) of this section, proceedings under this section shall be conducted in
accordance with rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to
section 75-110.</para>
