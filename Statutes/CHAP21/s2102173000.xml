13.03) (a) A record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer than
all the shares registered in the record shareholder's name but owned by a
beneficial shareholder only if the record shareholder objects with respect
to all shares of the class or series owned by the beneficial shareholder and
notifies the corporation in writing of the name and address of each beneficial
shareholder on whose behalf appraisal rights are being asserted. The rights
of a record shareholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the
shares held of record in the record shareholder's name under this subsection
shall be determined as if the shares as to which the record shareholder objects
and the record shareholder's other shares were registered in the names of
different record shareholders.</para>

may assert appraisal rights as to shares of any class or series held on behalf
of the shareholder only if such shareholder:</para><para>(1) Submits to the corporation the record
