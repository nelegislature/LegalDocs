limited liability company is named as or made a party in a derivative proceeding,
the company may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the
claims asserted in the proceeding and determine whether pursuing the action
is in the best interests of the company. If the company appoints a special
litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of the company,
except for good cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably
necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This subsection
does not prevent the court from enforcing a person's right to information
under section 21-139 or, for good cause shown, granting extraordinary relief
in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</para>

care, with the committee having the burden of proof. If the court finds that
the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the
committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the
court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court
shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this
section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the plaintiff.</para>
