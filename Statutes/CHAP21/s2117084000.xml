Such a lien shall not apply to an account in which the member may act solely on behalf of another person, nor shall it apply to an account in which the consent of a person not obligated on the loan or other obligation is required for a withdrawal. A credit union may exercise the lien up to the full amount of the account by offsetting funds in the account against any sums past due under such an obligation or, in the case of an obligation which has been accelerated, against the entire amount of the obligation.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1996, LB 948, &#167; 84. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
