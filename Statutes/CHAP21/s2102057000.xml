shareholders of the date, time, and place of each annual and special shareholders'
meeting no fewer than ten nor more than sixty days before the meeting date.
If the board of directors has authorized participation by means of remote
communication pursuant to section 21-261 for any class or series of shareholders,
the notice to such class or series of shareholders shall describe the means
of remote communication to be used. The notice shall include the record date
for determining the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such
date is different than the record date for determining shareholders entitled
to notice of the meeting. Unless the Nebraska Model Business Corporation Act
or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, the corporation is required
to give notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting as of
the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of the
meeting.</para>

or purposes for which the meeting is called.</para><para>(c) Notice of a special meeting must
