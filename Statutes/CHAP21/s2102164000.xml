of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation

of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan exists,

on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate
voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting

exchange by that voting group is present.</para><para>(6) Subject to subdivision (7) of this section, separate
voting by voting groups is required:</para><para>(i) On a plan of merger, by each class or series of
shares that:</para><para>(A)

obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities, or interests, cash,
other property, or any combination of the foregoing; or</para>

amendment to articles of incorporation of a surviving corporation, that requires
action by separate voting groups under section 21-2,153;</para>
<para>(ii) On a plan of share exchange,
by each class or series of shares included in the exchange with each class
or series constituting a separate voting group; and</para><para>(iii) On a plan of merger or share exchange,
if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote
as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or share exchange.</para>
<para>(7) The articles of incorporation
may expressly limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subdivisions
(6)(i)(A) and (6)(ii) of this section as to any class or series of shares,
except for a transaction that (i) includes what is or would be, if the corporation
were the surviving corporation, an amendment subject to subdivision (6)(i)(B)
of this section and (ii) will effect no significant change in the assets of
the resulting entity, including all parents and subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis.</para><para>(8)
Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation's
shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange is not required if:</para>

survive the merger or is the acquiring corporation in a share exchange;</para>
<para>(ii) Except for amendments
permitted by section 21-2,154, its articles of incorporation will not be changed;</para>
<para>(iii) Each shareholder of

with identical preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately
after the effective date of change; and</para><para>(iv) The issuance in the merger or share exchange
of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares
does not require a vote under subsection (f) of section 21-242.</para>

or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would
become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities
of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange
shall require the execution by each such shareholder of a separate written
consent to become subject to such owner liability.</para></amendatorysection>
