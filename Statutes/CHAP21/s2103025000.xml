on or before March 1 of each even-numbered year occupation taxes are due to

shall become delinquent, (b) the authority
of the delinquent corporation to
transact business in this state shall be administratively revoked on

shall on April 16 of such year administratively
revoke the authority of the corporation to transact business in this state for
