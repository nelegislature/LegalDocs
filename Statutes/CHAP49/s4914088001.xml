indicate no intent to file late, (b) the lobbyist has not been required to
pay a late filing fee for two years prior to the time the filing of the statement
was due, (c) the late filing of the statement shows that less than five thousand dollars was raised, received, or expended during
the reporting period, and (d) a reduction of the late fee would not frustrate
the purposes of the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act.</para>

to subsection (1) of this section who qualifies for an exemption to the filing
of quarterly statements pursuant to subsection (5) of section 49-1483 may

waive the late filing fee and the person shall not be required to make a showing
