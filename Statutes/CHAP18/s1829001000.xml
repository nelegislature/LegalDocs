urban growth bonds and refunding bonds.</catchline><para>(1) The Legislature recognizes
that there is a growing concern among municipalities that infrastructure costs
and needs are great, especially in areas that are on the edge of or near the
municipal boundaries and in need of development resources, and the governing
bodies of municipalities must identify and develop financing mechanisms to
respond to all infrastructure needs in an effective and efficient manner.
The authorization of urban growth bonds, with local option sales and use tax
revenue identified as the source of financing for the bonds, will encourage
municipalities to use such revenue to bond infrastructure needs.</para>
<para>(2) The governing
body of a municipality may create one or more urban growth districts for the
purpose of using local option sales and use tax revenue to finance municipal
infrastructure needs. An urban growth district may be in an area along the
edge of a municipality's boundary or in any other growth area designated by
the governing body, except that the territory of each urban growth district
shall be (a) within the municipality's corporate limits and (b) outside the
municipality's corporate limits as they existed as of the date twenty years
prior to the issuance of any urban growth bonds by a municipality under the
authority of this section.</para><para>(3) The governing body shall establish an urban growth
district by ordinance. The ordinance shall include:</para><para>(a) A description of the
boundaries of the proposed district; and</para><para>(b) The local option sales tax rate and estimated
urban growth local option sales and use tax revenue anticipated to be identified
as a result of the creation of the district.</para><para>(4) Any municipality that
has established an urban growth district may, by ordinance approved by a vote
of two-thirds of the members of its governing body, issue urban growth bonds
and refunding bonds to finance and refinance the construction or improvement
of roads, streets, streetscapes, bridges, and related structures within the
urban growth district and in any other area of the municipality. The bonds
shall be secured as to payment by a pledge, as determined by the municipality,
of the urban growth local option sales and use tax revenue and shall mature
not later than twenty-five years after the date of issuance. Annual debt service
on all bonds issued with respect to an urban growth district pursuant to this
section shall not exceed the urban growth local option sales and use tax revenue
with respect to such district for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year
in which the current series of such bonds are issued. For purposes of this
section, urban growth local option sales and use tax revenue means the municipality's
total local option sales and use tax revenue multiplied by the ratio of the
area included in the urban growth district to the total area of the municipality.</para>
<para>(5) The issuance
of urban growth bonds by any municipality under the authority of this section
shall not be subject to any charter or statutory limitations of indebtedness
or be subject to any restrictions imposed upon or conditions precedent to
the exercise of the powers of municipalities to issue bonds or evidences of
indebtedness which may be contained in such charters or other statutes. Any
municipality which issues urban growth bonds under the authority of this section
shall levy property taxes upon all the taxable property in the municipality
at such rate or rates within any applicable charter, statutory, or constitutional
limitations as will provide funds which, together with the urban growth local
option sales and use tax revenue pledged to the payment of such bonds and
any other money made available and used for that purpose, will be sufficient
to pay the principal of and interest on such urban growth bonds as they severally
mature.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2009, LB85, &#167; 1.</para></source>  </law>
