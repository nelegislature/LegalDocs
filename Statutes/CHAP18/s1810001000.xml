Notwithstanding any more general or special law respecting armories in force and effect in this state, the governing bodies of cities or villages are hereby empowered by ordinance to acquire through the exercise of the right of eminent domain, or otherwise, real estate to be used as a site or sites for the construction of state armories to be devoted to the uses and purposes of the Nebraska National Guard and State Guard and to convey such real estate without consideration, when acquired, to the State of Nebraska to the end that through state aid, federal aid, or both, state armory buildings may be constructed on such sites without cost to such cities or villages other than the cost to such cities or villages to acquire and convey such real estate.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1935, Spec.
