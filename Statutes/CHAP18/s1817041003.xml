The handicapped parking citation shall include a description of the handicapped parking infraction, the time and place at which the person cited is to appear, a warning that failure to appear in accordance with the command of the citation is a punishable offense, and such other matter as the Supreme Court deems appropriate, but shall not include a place for the cited person's social security number. The handicapped parking citation shall provide space for an affidavit by a peace officer certifying that the recipient of the citation is the lawful possessor in his or her own right of a handicapped or disabled parking permit and that the peace officer has personally viewed the permit. The Supreme Court may provide that a copy of the handicapped parking citation constitutes the complaint filed in the trial court.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1993, LB 632, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1211, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 82, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2011, LB163, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2021, LB163, &#167; 109. </para></source></law>
