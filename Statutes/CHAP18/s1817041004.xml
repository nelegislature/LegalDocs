Unless the person cited requests an earlier date, the time of appearance shall be at least three days after the issuance of the handicapped parking citation. One copy of the handicapped parking citation shall be delivered to the person cited or attached to the offending motor vehicle. At least twenty-four hours before the time set for the appearance of the cited person, either the prosecuting attorney or other person authorized by law to issue a complaint for the particular offense shall issue and file a complaint charging such person with a handicapped parking infraction or such person shall be released from the obligation to appear as specified. A person cited for a handicapped parking violation may waive his or her right to trial. For any handicapped parking citation issued for a handicapped parking infraction by reason of the failure of a vehicle to display a handicapped parking permit issued pursuant to section 18-1738 or 18-1738.01, the complaint shall be dismissed if, within seven business days after the date of issuance of the citation, the person cited files with the court the affidavit provided for in section 18-1741.03, signed by a peace officer certifying that the recipient is the lawful possessor in his or her own right of a handicapped parking permit issued under section 18-1738 or 18-1738.01 and that the peace officer has personally viewed the permit. The Supreme Court may prescribe uniform rules for such waivers. Anyone may use a credit card authorized by the court in which the person is cited as a means of payment of his or her fine and costs.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1993, LB 632, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1211, &#167; 11. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
