<para>(2) If an area is not blighted or substandard, a city may designate

<para>(3) Upon designation of an enhanced employment area under this section,
a city may levy a general business occupation tax upon the businesses and
users of space within such enhanced employment area for the purpose of paying
all or any part of the costs and expenses of authorized work within such enhanced

imposed pursuant to this section shall make a reasonable classification of
businesses, users of space, or kinds of transactions for purposes of imposing
such tax, except that no occupation tax shall be imposed on any transaction
which is subject to tax under section 53-160, 66-489, 66-489.02, 66-4,140,
66-4,145, 66-4,146, 77-2602, or 77-4008 or which is exempt from tax under
section 77-2704.24. The collection of a tax imposed pursuant to
this section shall be made and enforced in such a manner as the governing
body shall by ordinance determine to produce the required revenue. The governing
body may provide that failure to pay the tax imposed pursuant to this section
shall constitute a violation of the ordinance and subject the violator to
a fine or other punishment as provided by ordinance. Any occupation tax levied
by the city under this section shall remain in effect so long as the city
has bonds outstanding which have been issued under the authority of this section
and are secured by such occupation tax or that state such occupation tax as
an available source for payment. The total amount of occupation taxes levied
shall not exceed the total costs and expenses of the authorized work including
the total debt service requirements of any bonds the proceeds of which are
expended for or allocated to such authorized work. The assessments or taxes
levied must be specified by ordinance and the proceeds shall not be used for
any purpose other than the making of such improvements and for the repayment
of bonds issued in whole or in part for the financing of such improvements.
The authority to levy the general business occupation tax contained in this
section and the authority to issue bonds secured by or payable from such occupation
tax shall be independent of and separate from any occupation tax referenced
in section 18-2103.</para>
<para>(4) A city may issue revenue bonds for the purpose of defraying the
cost of authorized work and to secure the payment of such bonds with the occupation
tax revenue described in this section. Such revenue bonds may be issued in
one or more series or issues where deemed advisable, and each such series
or issue may contain different maturity dates, interest rates, priorities
on revenue available for payment of such bonds and priorities on securities
available for guaranteeing payment thereof, and such other differing terms
and conditions as are deemed necessary. The following shall apply to any such
bonds:</para>
<para>(a) Such bonds shall be limited obligations of the city. Bonds and interest
on such bonds, issued under the authority of this section, shall not constitute
nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the city or a charge against its
general credit or taxing powers. Such limitation shall be plainly stated upon
the face of each of such bonds;</para>
<para>(b) Such bonds may (i) be executed and delivered at any time and from
time to time, (ii) be in such form and denominations, (iii) be of such tenor,
(iv) be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding
twenty years from their date, (v) be payable at such place or places, (vi)
bear interest at such rate or rates, payable at such place or places, and
evidenced in such manner, (vii) be redeemable prior to maturity, with or without
premium, and (viii) contain such provisions as shall be deemed in the best
interest of the city and provided for in the proceedings of the governing
body under which the bonds shall be authorized to be issued;</para>
<para>(c) The authorization, terms, issuance, execution, or delivery of such
bonds shall not be subject to sections 10-101 to 10-126; and</para>
<para>(d) Such bonds may be sold at public or private sale in such manner
and at such time or times as may be determined by the governing body to be
most advantageous. The city may pay all expenses, premiums, and commissions
which the governing body may deem necessary or advantageous in connection
with the authorization, sale, and issuance thereof from the proceeds or the
sale of the bonds or from the revenue of the occupation tax described in this
section.</para>
