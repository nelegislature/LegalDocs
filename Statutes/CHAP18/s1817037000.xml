<para>(1) Any city or village, any state agency, and any person
in lawful possession of any offstreet parking facility may designate stalls
or spaces, including access aisles, in such facility owned or operated by
the city, village, state agency, or person for the exclusive use of handicapped
or disabled persons whose motor vehicles display the distinguishing license
plates issued to such individuals pursuant to section 60-3,113, such other
handicapped or disabled persons or temporarily handicapped or disabled persons whose
motor vehicles display a handicapped or disabled parking permit, and such other
motor vehicles which display a
handicapped or disabled parking permit. Such designation shall
be made by posting aboveground and immediately adjacent to and visible from
each stall or space, including access aisles, a sign which is in conformance
with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted pursuant to section
60-6,118 and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the federal regulations adopted in response
to the act, as the act and the regulations existed on January
1, 2011.</para>
<para>(2) The owner or person in lawful possession of an offstreet
parking facility, after notifying the police or sheriff's department, as the
case may be, and any city, village, or state agency providing onstreet parking
or owning, operating, or providing an offstreet parking facility may cause
the removal, from a stall or space, including access aisles, designated exclusively
for handicapped or disabled persons or temporarily handicapped or disabled
persons or motor vehicles for the transportation of handicapped or disabled
persons or temporarily handicapped or disabled persons, of any vehicle not
displaying the proper handicapped
or disabled parking permit or the distinguishing license plates
specified in this section if there is posted aboveground and immediately adjacent
to and visible from such stall or space, including access aisles, a sign which
clearly and conspicuously states the area so designated as a tow-in zone.</para>
<para>(3) A person who parks a vehicle in any onstreet parking space
or access aisle which has been designated exclusively for handicapped or disabled
persons or temporarily handicapped or disabled persons or motor vehicles for
the transportation of handicapped or disabled persons or temporarily handicapped
or disabled persons, or in any so exclusively designated parking space or
access aisle in any offstreet parking facility, without properly displaying
the proper license plates or
handicapped or disabled parking permit or when the handicapped
or disabled person to whom or for whom, as the case may be, the license plate
or permit is issued will not enter or exit the vehicle while it is parked
in the designated space or access aisle shall be guilty of a handicapped parking
infraction as defined in section 18-1741.01 and shall be subject to the penalties
and procedures set forth in sections 18-1741.01 to 18-1741.07. The display
on a motor vehicle of a distinguishing license plate or permit issued to a
handicapped or disabled person by and under the duly constituted authority
of another state shall constitute a full and complete defense in any action
for a handicapped parking infraction as defined in section 18-1741.01. If
the identity of the person who parked the vehicle in violation of this section
cannot be readily determined, the owner or person in whose name the vehicle
is registered shall be held prima facie responsible for such violation and
shall be guilty and subject to the penalties and procedures described in this
section. In the case of a privately owned offstreet parking facility, a city
or village shall not require the owner or person in lawful possession of such
facility to inform the city or village of a violation of this section prior
to the city or village issuing the violator a handicapped parking infraction
citation.</para>
<para>(4) For purposes of this section and section 18-1741.01, state
agency means any division, department, board, bureau, commission, or agency
of the State of Nebraska created by the Constitution of Nebraska or established
by act of the Legislature, including the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska
state colleges, when the entity owns, leases, controls, or manages property
which includes offstreet parking facilities.</para>
