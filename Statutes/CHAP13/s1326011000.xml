<para>(1) The applicant political subdivision may issue from time to time
its bonds and refunding bonds to finance and refinance the acquisition, construction,
improving, and equipping of eligible facilities and appurtenant public facilities
that are a part of the same project. The bonds may be sold by the applicant
in such manner and for such price as the applicant determines, at a discount,
at par, or at a premium, at private negotiated sale or at public sale, after
notice published prior to the sale in a legal newspaper having general circulation
in the political subdivision or in such other medium of publication as the
applicant deems appropriate. The bonds shall have a stated maturity of thirty
years or less and shall bear interest at such rate or rates and otherwise
be issued in accordance with the respective procedures and with such other
terms and provisions as are established, permitted, or authorized by applicable
state laws and home rule charters for the type of bonds to be issued. Such
bonds may be secured as to payment in whole or in part by a pledge, as shall
be determined by the applicant, from the income, proceeds, and revenue of
the eligible facilities financed with proceeds of such bonds, from the income,
proceeds, and revenue of any of its eligible facilities, or from its revenue
and income, including its sales, use, or occupation tax revenue, fees, or
receipts, as may be determined by the applicant. The applicant may further
secure the bonds by a mortgage or deed of trust encumbering all or any portion
of the eligible facilities and by a bond insurance policy or other credit
support facility. No general obligation bonds, except refunding bonds, shall
be issued until authorized by greater than fifty percent of the applicant's
electors voting on the question as to their issuance at any election as defined in section 32-108. The face of the
bonds shall plainly state that the bonds and the interest thereon shall not
constitute nor give rise to an indebtedness, obligation, or pecuniary liability
of the state nor a charge against the general credit, revenue, or taxing power
of the state. Bonds of the applicant are declared to be issued for an essential
public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon and income
therefrom, shall be exempt from all state income taxes.</para>
<para>(2) All payments to political subdivisions under the Convention Center
Facility Financing Assistance Act are made subject to specific appropriation
for such purpose. Nothing in the act precludes the Legislature from amending
or repealing the act at any time.</para>
