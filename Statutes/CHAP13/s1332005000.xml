Any third-party lender collecting annual assessments directly from the owner of the qualifying property shall notify the municipality within three business days if an annual assessment becomes delinquent.</para><para>(8) Collection of annual assessments shall only be sought from the original owners or subsequent purchasers of qualifying property subject to an assessment contract.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2016, LB1012, &#167; 5; </para><para>R.S.Supp.,2016, &#167; 18-3205; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB625, &#167; 5; </para><para>Laws 2019, LB23, &#167; 4. </para><effectivedate>May 2, 2019</effectivedate></source></law>
