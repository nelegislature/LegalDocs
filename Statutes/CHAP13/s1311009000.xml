<para>(1) Sections 13-1101 to 13-1110 shall not be construed as a restriction
or limitation upon any powers which a municipality or county might otherwise
have under any laws of this state but
shall be construed as cumulative.</para>
<para>(2) Sections 13-1101
to 13-1110 shall be full authority for the exercise of the powers described
in such sections by a municipality or county, and no action, proceeding, or

sections, except as specifically provided in such sections, any provision
of law applicable to a municipality or county to the contrary notwithstanding.

financing construction, rehabilitation, or purchase of projects as provided
in such sections and the issuance, payment, redemption, registration, sale,

county, or governing body or officer thereof shall be subject to the Securities

<para>(4) In any suit, action,
or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any agreement of
a municipality or county brought after the lapse of thirty days after the

that it has been entered into by the municipality or county to provide financing
for a project shall be conclusively deemed to have been entered into for such
purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned,
located, and carried out in accordance with sections 13-1101 to 13-1110.</para>
