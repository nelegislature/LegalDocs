The Legislature further declares that judicial interpretations of section 13-912 governing the liability of counties on January 1, 1970, also shall be controlling on the liability of all political subdivisions for the alleged insufficiency or want of repair of any highway or bridge or other public thoroughfare. Notwithstanding other provisions of the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act and sections 16-727, 16-728, 23-175, 39-809, and 79-610, sections 13-912 to 13-914 shall be the only sections governing determination of liability of political subdivisions for the alleged insufficiency or want of repair of highways, or bridges or other public thoroughfares. As used in sections 13-912 and 13-913, public thoroughfares shall include all streets, alleys, and roads designed, intended, and primarily used for the movement of vehicular traffic and dedicated to public use.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 138, &#167; 11, p. 631; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 10, &#167; 2; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1983), &#167; 23-2411; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 1027.</para></source><annotation><para>County held liable for damages caused by insufficient bridge railing.
