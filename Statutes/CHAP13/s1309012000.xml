The procedure for filing such claims and bringing suit shall be the same for claims under this section as for other claims under the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act and sections 16-727, 16-728, 23-175, 39-809, and 79-610. No political subdivision shall be liable for damages occasioned by defects in state highways and bridges thereon which the Department of Transportation is required to maintain, but the political subdivision shall not be relieved of liability until the state has actually undertaken construction or maintenance of such highways. It is the intent of the Legislature that minimum maintenance highways and roads shall not be deemed to be insufficient or in want of repair when they meet the minimum standards for such highways and roads pursuant to section 39-2109.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1889, c. 7, &#167; 4, p. 78; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 2995; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 2746; </para><para>Laws 1929, c. 171, &#167; 1, p. 585; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 39-832; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 39-834; </para><para>Laws 1959, c. 167, &#167; 2, p. 609; </para><para>R.R.S.1943, &#167; 39-834; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 138, &#167; 10, p. 630; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 10, &#167; 1; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1983), &#167; 23-2410; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 1026; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB339, &#167; 74. </para></source><annotation><para><emphasis>1.
