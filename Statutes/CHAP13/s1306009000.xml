The committee shall consist of the State Treasurer, the Tax Commissioner, the director, and representatives from counties, cities, and other political subdivisions as may be appropriate. The committee shall develop recommendations for the contracting of such services. The State Treasurer and the director shall contract with one or more credit card, charge card, or debit card companies or third-party merchant banks for services on behalf of the state and those counties, cities, and political subdivisions that choose to participate in the state contract for such services. The State Treasurer and the director shall consider, for purposes of this section, any negotiated discount, processing, or transaction fee imposed by a credit card, charge card, or debit card company or third-party merchant bank as an administrative expense. Counties, cities, and other political subdivisions that choose not to participate in the state contract may choose types of credit cards, charge cards, and debit cards and may negotiate and contract independently or collectively as a governmental entity with one or more financial institutions, vending service companies, credit card, charge card, or debit card companies, or third-party merchant banks for the provision of such services. All county officials within each county choosing to accept credit cards, charge cards, and debit cards shall contract for services through the same financial institutions, vending service companies, credit card, charge card, or debit card companies, or third-party merchant banks for the provision of such services. County officials who accept credit cards, charge cards, and debit cards shall notify the county board of such decision and the discount or administrative fees charged for such service.</para><para>(6) A county treasurer, county official, or political subdivision official authorizing acceptance of credit card or charge card payments shall be authorized but not required to impose a surcharge or convenience fee upon the person making a payment by credit card or charge card so as to wholly or partially offset the amount of any discount or administrative fees charged to the political subdivision, but the surcharge or convenience fee shall not exceed the surcharge or convenience fee imposed by the credit card or charge card companies or third-party merchant banks which have contracted under subsection (5) of this section. The surcharge or convenience fee shall be applied only when allowed by the operating rules and regulations of the credit card or charge card involved or when authorized in writing by the credit card or charge card company involved. When a person elects to make a payment to a political subdivision by credit card or charge card and such a surcharge or convenience fee is imposed, the payment of such surcharge or convenience fee shall be deemed voluntary by such person and shall be in no case refundable. If a payment is made electronically by credit card, charge card, debit card, or electronic funds transfer as part of a system for providing or retrieving information electronically, the county treasurer, county official, or political subdivision official shall be authorized but not required to impose an additional surcharge or convenience fee upon the person making a payment.</para><para>(7) For purposes of this section, electronic funds transfer means the movement of funds by nonpaper means, usually through a payment system, including, but not limited to, an automated clearinghouse or the Federal Reserve's Fedwire system.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 70, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 994, &#167; 1.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
