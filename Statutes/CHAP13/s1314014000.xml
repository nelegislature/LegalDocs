Such publications shall be made at least thirty days before the time fixed for the opening of said bids and contracting for such work. A contract may then be made with the lowest responsible bidder therefor, unless the board deems the bids excessive or unsuitable, in which event it may proceed to readvertise for bids, or the board may do the work directly, purchasing such materials and contracting for such labor as may be necessary without further notice or proposal for bids; except that it shall make no purchase of materials in amounts exceeding five hundred dollars except by public letting upon ten days' notice, published as aforesaid, specifying the materials proposed to be purchased; <emphasis type="italic">Provided,</emphasis> that said public letting shall not be required in case no satisfactory bids are received, or in case of an emergency where the delay of advertising and public letting might cause serious loss or injury to the work. The board shall, in all cases, have the right to reject any and all bids, and may either readvertise therefor, contract with others at a figure not exceeding that of the lowest bidder without further advertising, or do the work directly as hereinbefore provided.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1937, c. 37, &#167; 3, p. 172; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 18-2003; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 18-713; </para><para>Laws 1967, c. 84, &#167; 11, p. 265; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1983), &#167; 18-713.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
