If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and the same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 42-711 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.</para><para>(d) In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.</para><para>(e) On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</para><para>(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) of this section and subsection (b) of section 42-705, a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:</para><para>(1) one party resides in another state; and</para><para>(2) the other party resides outside the United States.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1993, LB 500, &#167; 46; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 727, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 148, &#167; 82; </para><para>Laws 2015, LB415, &#167; 44. </para></source><annotation><para>Under this section and section 42-739, a responding state becomes an issuing state when it assumes continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify a foreign child support order and must apply its own substantive law to the modification. Under this section, a responding state acquires jurisdiction to modify the child support provisions of a foreign divorce decree once the following three conditions are met: (1) Both the parents and the children have moved away from the issuing state; (2) one of the parents, who is a nonresident of the responding state, seeks modification in the responding state, and (3) the other parent becomes subject to the personal jurisdiction of the responding state.
