In the event of such application and acceptance, the court shall have the same jurisdiction over the controversy and the parties thereto, or having any relation thereto, that it has under the provisions of sections 42-801 to 42-823 in similar cases involving the welfare of children.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1965, c. 228, &#167; 23, p. 662. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
