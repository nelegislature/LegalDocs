        <para>The inference that residency in Nebraska has been with the intent to make it one's permanent home is negated where he or she is a nonimmigrant alien residing in Nebraska on a visitor's visa.

Svacek, 272 Neb. 567, 723 N.W.2d 329 (2006).</para><para>One who proves he or she met the durational residency requirement shall be permitted the inference that such residency was with the intention to make Nebraska a permanent home, absent a showing that the residency was a sham and not bona fide.

The mere residing at a different place, although evidence of a change, is, however long continued, per se insufficient. A brief move to another location to see if living with one's spouse will succeed may not indicate present intent to change one's domicile. Lasu v. Lasu, 28 Neb.
