duties.</catchline><para>(1)
In any judicial or administrative proceeding, any property or material that
constitutes a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct, as defined in
section 28-1463.02, and which has a child, as defined in such section, as
one of its participants or portrayed observers, shall remain constantly and
continuously in the care, custody, and control of law enforcement, the prosecuting
attorney, or the court having properly received it into evidence, except as
provided in subsection (3) of this section.</para>
<para>(2) All courts
and administrative agencies shall unequivocally deny any request by the defendant,
his or her attorney, or any other person, agency, or organization, regardless
of whether such defendant, attorney, or other person, agency, or organization
is a party in interest or not, to acquire possession of, copy, photograph,
duplicate, or otherwise reproduce any property or material that constitutes
a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct, as defined in section 28-1463.02,
and which has a child, as defined in such section, as one of its participants
or portrayed observers, so long as the state makes the property or material
reasonably available to the defendant in a criminal proceeding. Nothing in
this section shall be deemed to prohibit the review of the proscribed materials
or property by a federal court when considering a habeas corpus claim.</para>
<para>(3)(a) For
purposes of this section, property or material are deemed to be reasonably
available to a defendant if the state provides ample opportunity for inspection,
viewing, examination, and analysis of the property or material, at a law enforcement
or state-operated facility, to the defendant, his or her attorney, and any
individual the defendant seeks to use for the purpose of furnishing expert
testimony.</para><para>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a court
may order a copy of the property or material to be delivered to a person identified
as a defense expert for the purpose of evaluating the evidence, subject to
the same restrictions placed upon law enforcement. The defense expert shall
return all copies and materials to law enforcement upon completion of the
evaluation.</para><para>(4) On or before July 1, 2009, the Supreme Court shall adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations regarding the proper control, care, custody,
transfer, and disposition of property or material that constitutes a visual
depiction of sexually explicit conduct, as defined in section 28-1463.02,
and which has a child, as defined in such section, as one of its participants
or portrayed observers, that has been received into evidence at any judicial
or administrative proceeding. Among the issues addressed by these rules and
regulations, the Supreme Court should devise procedures regarding the preparation
and delivery of bills of exception containing evidence as described in this
section, as well as procedures for storing, accessing, and disposing of such
bills of exception after preparation and receipt.</para></amendatorysection>
