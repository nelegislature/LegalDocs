The State Treasurer may receive and credit to the fund any sum or sums which may at any time be contributed to the state or the fund by the United States of America or any agency thereof to which the state may be or become entitled under any act of Congress or otherwise by reason of any payment made from the fund.</para><para>(11) When the fund equals or exceeds two million three hundred thousand dollars, no further contributions thereto shall be required by employers, risk management pools, or insurance companies. Thereafter whenever the amount of the fund is reduced below one million two hundred thousand dollars by reason of payments made pursuant to this section or otherwise or whenever the administrator of the compensation court determines that payments likely to be made from the fund in the next succeeding year will probably cause the fund to be reduced below one million two hundred thousand dollars, the administrator shall notify all self-insurers and the Director of Insurance, who shall notify all workers' compensation insurance companies and risk management pools, that such contributions are to be resumed as of the date set in such notice and such contributions shall continue as provided in this section after the effective date of such notice. Such contributions shall continue until the fund again equals two million three hundred thousand dollars.</para><para>(12) Any expenses necessarily incurred by the Workers' Compensation Trust Fund or by the Attorney General in connection with a proceeding brought by or against the fund may be paid out of the fund. Such expenses may be taxed as costs and recovered by the fund in any case in which the fund prevails.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 808, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 811, &#167; 95; </para><para>Laws 1987, LB 398, &#167; 46; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 1034, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 1006, &#167; 95; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 757, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 1221, &#167; 12; </para><para>Laws 2004, LB 1091, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 13, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB322, &#167; 8.</para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Administrative Procedure Act,</emphasis> see section 84-920.</para><para><emphasis>Risk management pool,</emphasis> defined, see section 44-4303.</para></crossreference></law></legaldoc>
