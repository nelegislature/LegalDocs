Wadkins v. Lecuona, 274 Neb. 352, 740 N.W.2d 34 (2007).</para><para>In determining whether wages are payable with respect to a time period, within the meaning of subsection (27) of this section, the test is not in what week the remuneration is received but in what week it is earned or to which it may reasonably be considered to apply. Generally speaking, wages are tied to the week of work and not to the week in which they are paid. Wadkins v. Lecuona, 274 Neb. 352, 740 N.W.2d 34 (2007).</para><para>Vacation pay, within the meaning of subsection (18) of this section, is generally regarded, not as a gratuity or gift, but as additional wages for services performed. It is not in the nature of compensation for the calendar days it covers — it is more like a contracted-for bonus for a whole year's work. A "vacation" is also understood to be a respite from active duty, during which activity or work is suspended, purposed for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. Wadkins v. Lecuona, 274 Neb. 352, 740 N.W.2d 34 (2007).</para><para>Under former law, wages may include noncash benefits under certain circumstances.

American Employers Group Inc. v. Department of Labor, 260 Neb. 405, 617 N.W.2d 808 (2000).</para><para>Under the former law, pursuant to subsection (24) of this section, employees who agree to take their earned vacation at a specific period of time for the employer's convenience under the expectation that their employment will continue after that period are not unemployed for the purpose of receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Vlasic Foods International v. Lecuona, 260 Neb. 397, 618 N.W.2d 403 (2000).</para><para>One performing services under a contract but not receiving wages, as defined by subsection (16) of this section, performs services under a contract of hire unless one is an independent contractor, as defined by the common law. Omaha World-Herald v. Dernier, 253 Neb. 215, 570 N.W.2d 508 (1997).</para><para>A professional symphony musician employed under a seasonal contract rather than an annual contract was entitled to unemployment benefits for the time he was unemployed during the symphony's "off season".
