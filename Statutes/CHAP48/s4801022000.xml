Beginning in 2023, the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Court shall annually adjust the dollar limitation in this subsection. The adjusted limitation shall be equal to the then current limitation adjusted by the greater of one percent or the percentage change, for the preceding year, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, as prepared by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

If the compensation court determines that the interests of the nonresident alien dependent will be better served by such person than by the consular officer, the compensation court shall appoint such person to act as attorney in fact in such proceedings. In making such determination the court shall consider, among other things, whether a consular officer's jurisdiction includes Nebraska and the responsiveness of the consular officer to attempts made by an attorney representing the employee to engage such consular officer in the proceedings.</para><para>(b) Such consular officer or appointed person shall have in behalf of such nonresident alien dependents the exclusive right to institute proceedings for, adjust, and settle all claims for compensation provided by the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act and to receive the distribution to such nonresident alien dependents of all compensation arising thereunder.</para><para>(c) A person appointed under subdivision (5)(a)(ii) of this section shall furnish a bond satisfactory to the compensation court conditioned upon the proper application of any money received as compensation under the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act.
