ten percent, or, if higher, the minimum percentage reduction required to be
eligible for short-time compensation, of the usual weekly hours of work for
the short-time compensation employer, the short-time compensation payable
to the individual is reduced for that week and is determined by multiplying
the weekly unemployment benefit amount for a week of total unemployment by
the percentage by which the combined hours of work have been reduced by ten
percent, or, if higher, the minimum percentage reduction required to be eligible
for short-time compensation, or more of the individual's usual weekly hours
of work. A week for which benefits are paid under this subdivision shall be
reported as a week of short-time compensation; and</para><para>(c) If an individual worked
the reduced percentage of the usual weekly hours of work for the short-time
compensation employer and is available for all his or her usual hours of work
with the short-time compensation employer, and the individual did not work
any hours for the other employer, either because of the lack of work with
that employer or because the individual is excused from work with the other
employer, the individual shall be eligible for short-time compensation for
that week. The benefit amount for such week shall be calculated as provided
in subsection (1) of this section.</para><para>(6) An individual who is not provided any
work during a week by the short-time compensation employer, or any other employer,
and who is otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation shall be eligible
for the amount of unemployment compensation to which he or she would otherwise
be eligible.</para><para>(7) An individual who is not provided any work by the short-time
compensation employer during a week, but who works for another employer and
is otherwise eligible, may be paid unemployment compensation for that week
subject to the disqualifying income and other provisions applicable to claims
for regular compensation.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2014, LB961, &#167; 21.</para></source>  </law>
