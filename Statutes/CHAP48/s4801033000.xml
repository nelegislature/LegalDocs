The notice shall be in writing and shall state in ordinary language the time, place, and cause of the injury. It shall be signed by the person injured, or by a person in his or her behalf, or in the event of his or her death, by his or her legal representative or by a person in his or her behalf. The notice shall be served upon the employer or an agent thereof. Such service may be made by delivering the notice to the person on whom it is to be served, or leaving it at his or her residence or place of business, or by sending it by certified or registered mail addressed to the person or corporation on whom it is to be served at his or her last-known residence or place of business. A notice given pursuant to this section shall not be held invalid or insufficient by reason of any inaccuracy in stating the time, place, or cause of the injury, unless it is shown that it was the intention to mislead, and the employer, or the insurance company carrying such risk, as the case may be, was in fact misled thereby. Want of such written notice shall not be a bar to proceedings under the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act, if it be shown that the employer had notice or knowledge of the injury.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1913, c. 198, &#167; 33, p. 593; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 3674; </para><para>Laws 1917, c. 85, &#167; 11, p. 209; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 3056; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 48-133; </para><para>Laws 1935, c. 57, &#167; 21, p. 198; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 48-133; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 48-133; </para><para>Laws 1961, c. 234, &#167; 2, p. 692; </para><para>Laws 1977, LB 144, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 811, &#167; 52; </para><para>Laws 1987, LB 93, &#167; 16.</para></source><annotation><para><emphasis>1.
