Any such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless, within thirty days after the prompt mailing of notice thereof to his or her last-known address or in the absence of mailing within thirty days after the delivery of such notice, the employer files an appeal with the department in accordance with rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the commissioner. No employer shall have standing, in any proceeding involving his or her combined tax rate or combined tax liability, to contest the chargeability to his or her account of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination, or decision pursuant to sections 48-629 to 48-644 except upon the ground that the services on the basis of which such benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for him or her and only in the event that he or she was not a party to such determination, redetermination, or decision or to any other proceedings under the Employment Security Law in which the character of such services was determined. A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with such hearing. All testimony at any such hearing shall be recorded but need not be transcribed unless there is a further appeal. The employer shall be promptly notified of a hearing officer's decision which shall become final unless the employer or the commissioner appeals within thirty days after the date of service of the decision of the hearing officer. The appeal shall otherwise be governed by the Administrative Procedure Act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1941, c. 94, &#167; 5, p. 391; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 48-707; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 48-650; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 339, &#167; 35; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 342, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 352, &#167; 88; </para><para>Laws 1994, LB 1337, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 192, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB172, &#167; 68. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Administrative Procedure Act,</emphasis> see section 84-920.</para></crossreference><annotation><para>A petition for judicial review of the Nebraska Commissioner of Labor's determination of an employer's unemployment insurance contributions must be filed in the county where the first adjudicated hearing of a disputed claim took place.
