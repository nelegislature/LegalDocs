insurance; provisions required; approval by Department of Insurance; effect
of bankruptcy.</catchline><para>No policy of insurance against
liability arising under the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act shall be issued
and no agreement pursuant to section 44-4304 providing group self-insurance
coverage of workers' compensation liability by a risk management pool shall
have any force or effect unless it contains the agreement of the workers'
compensation insurer or risk management pool that it will promptly pay to
the person entitled to the same all benefits conferred by such act, and all
installments of the compensation that may be awarded or agreed upon, and that
the obligation shall not be affected by the insolvency or bankruptcy of the
employer or his or her estate or discharge therein or by any default of the employer after the injury, or by any default
in the giving of any notice required by such policy, or otherwise. Such agreement
shall be construed to be a direct promise by the workers' compensation insurer
or risk management pool to the person entitled to compensation enforceable
in his or her name. Each workers' compensation insurance policy and each agreement
forming a risk management pool shall be deemed to be made subject to the Nebraska
Workers' Compensation Act. No corporation, association, or organization shall
enter into a workers' compensation insurance policy unless copies of such
forms have been filed with and approved by the Department of Insurance. Each
workers' compensation insurance policy and each agreement pursuant to section
44-4304 providing group self-insurance coverage of workers' compensation liability
by a risk management pool shall contain a clause to the effect (1) that as
between the employer and the workers' compensation insurer or risk management
pool the notice to or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part
of the employer shall be deemed notice
or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of the insurer or risk management
pool, (2) that jurisdiction of the employer for the purpose of
such act shall be jurisdiction of the insurer or risk management pool, and
(3) that the insurer or risk management pool shall in all things be bound
by the awards, judgments, or decrees rendered against such employer.
Except when the Professional Employer Organization Registration Act allows
coverage to be limited to co-employees as specified in a professional employer
agreement, each workers' compensation insurance policy and each
agreement providing such group self-insurance coverage shall include within
its terms the payment of compensation to all employees who are within the
scope and purview of the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act, including potential new or unknown employees.</para>
