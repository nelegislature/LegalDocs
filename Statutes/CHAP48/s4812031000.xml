An employee having a claim for wages which are not paid within thirty days
of the regular payday designated or agreed upon may institute suit for such
unpaid wages in the proper court. If an employee establishes a claim and secures
judgment on the claim, such employee shall be entitled to recover (a) the
full amount of the judgment and all costs of such suit and (b) if such employee
has employed an attorney in the case, an amount for attorney's fees assessed
by the court, which fees shall not be less than twenty-five percent of the
unpaid wages. If the cause is taken to an appellate court and the plaintiff
recovers a judgment, the appellate court shall tax as costs in the action,
to be paid to the plaintiff, an additional amount for attorney's fees in such
appellate court, which fees shall not be less than twenty-five percent of
the unpaid wages. If the employee fails to recover a judgment in excess of
the amount that may have been tendered within thirty days of the regular payday
by an employer, such employee shall not recover the attorney's fees provided
by this section. If the court finds that no reasonable dispute existed as
to the fact that wages were owed or as to the amount of such wages, the court
may order the employee to pay the employer's attorney's fees and costs of
the action as assessed by the court.</para>
<para>(2) An employer who fails to furnish a wage statement under subsection
(2) of section 48-1230 shall be guilty of an infraction as defined in section
29-431 and shall be subject to a fine pursuant to section 29-436.</para>
