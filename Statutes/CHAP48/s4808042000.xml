The Legislature may, during the 1987 regular session, prohibit by law any order of the Commission of Industrial Relations relating to state employees for fiscal year 1987-88 if it finds such order will be inconsistent with any legislation passed during the 1987 regular session dealing with collective bargaining by state employees.
