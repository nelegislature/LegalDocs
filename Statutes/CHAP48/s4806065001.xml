foreign state or government; recovery.</catchline><para>Any person who has
received any sum as benefits to which he or she was not entitled from any
agency which administers an employment security law of another state or foreign
government and who has been found liable to repay benefits received under
such law may be required to repay to the commissioner for such state or foreign
government the amount found due. Such amount, without interest, may be collected
(1) by civil action in the name of the commissioner acting as agent for such
agency, (2) by offset against any future benefits payable to the claimant
under the Employment Security Law for any benefit year which may commence
within three years after the claimant was notified such amount was due, except
that no such recoupment by the withholding of future benefits shall be had
if such sum was received by such person without fault on his or her part and
such recoupment would defeat the purpose of the Employment Security Law or
would be against equity and good conscience, (3) by setoff against any state income tax
refund due the claimant pursuant to sections 77-27,197 to 77-27,209, or (4) as provided in subsection (2)
of section 48-665.</para>
