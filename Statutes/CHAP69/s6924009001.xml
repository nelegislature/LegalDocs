<para>(1) For purposes of sections 69-2401 to 69-2425, the Nebraska
State Patrol shall be furnished with only such information as may be necessary
for the sole purpose of determining whether an individual is disqualified
from purchasing or possessing a handgun pursuant to state law or is subject
to the disability provisions of 18 U.S.C. 922(d)(4) and (g)(4). Such information
shall be furnished by the Department of Health and Human Services. The clerks
of the various courts shall furnish to the Department of Health and Human
Services and Nebraska State Patrol, as soon as practicable but within thirty
days after an order of commitment or discharge is issued or after removal
of firearm-related disabilities pursuant to section 71-963, all information
necessary to set up and maintain the database required by this section. This
information shall include (a) information regarding those persons who are
currently receiving mental health treatment pursuant to a commitment order
of a mental health board or who have been discharged, (b) information regarding
those persons who have been committed to treatment pursuant to section 29-3702,
and (c) information regarding those persons who have had firearm-related disabilities
removed pursuant to section 71-963. The mental health board shall notify the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Nebraska State Patrol when
such disabilities have been removed. The Department of Health and Human Services
shall also maintain in the database a listing of persons committed to treatment
pursuant to section 29-3702. To ensure the accuracy of the database, any
information maintained or disclosed under this subsection shall be updated,
corrected, modified, or removed, as appropriate, and as soon as practicable,
from any database that the state or federal government maintains and makes
available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The procedures
for furnishing the information shall guarantee that no information is released
beyond what is necessary for purposes of this section.</para>
<para>(2) In order to comply with sections 69-2401 and 69-2403 to
69-2408 and this section, the Nebraska State Patrol shall provide to the chief
of police or sheriff of an applicant's place of residence or a licensee in
the process of a criminal history record check pursuant to section 69-2411
only the information regarding whether or not the applicant is disqualified
from purchasing or possessing a handgun.</para>
<para>(3) Any person, agency, or mental health board participating
in good faith in the reporting or disclosure of records and communications
under this section is immune from any liability, civil, criminal, or otherwise,
that might result by reason of the action.</para>
<para>(4) Any person who intentionally causes the Nebraska State
Patrol to request information pursuant to this section without reasonable
belief that the named individual has submitted a written application under
section 69-2404 or has completed a consent form under section 69-2410 shall
be guilty of a Class II misdemeanor in addition to other civil or criminal
liability under state or federal law.</para>
<para>(5) The Nebraska
State Patrol and the Department of Health and Human Services shall report
electronically to the Clerk of the Legislature on a biannual basis the following
information about the database: (a) The number of total records of persons
unable to purchase or possess firearms because of disqualification or disability
shared with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System; (b) the
number of shared records by category of such persons; (c) the change in number
of total shared records and change in number of records by category from the
previous six months; (d) the number of records existing but not able to be
shared with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System because
the record was incomplete and unable to be accepted by the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System; and (e) the number of hours or days, if
any, during which the database was unable to share records with the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System and the reason for such inability.
The report shall also be published on the web sites of the Nebraska State
Patrol and the Department of Health and Human Services.</para>
