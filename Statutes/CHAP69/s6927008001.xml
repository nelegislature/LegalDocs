<para>(2) The liability
of a stamping agent for escrow deposits shall be calculated as follows: If
there is a shortfall amount for a nonparticipating manufacturer for a calendar
quarter, each stamping agent that sold cigarettes of that nonparticipating
manufacturer during the calendar quarter shall deposit into such escrow account
as shall be designated by the state an amount equal to the applicable shortfall
amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of cigarettes
of that nonparticipating manufacturer sold in or into the state by the stamping
agent during that calendar quarter and the denominator of which is the total
number of cigarettes of that nonparticipating manufacturer sold by all stamping
agents in or into the state during that calendar quarter, except that any
nonparticipating manufacturer cigarettes sold in or into the state by a stamping
agent during the calendar quarter in which the stamping agent collected and
deposited the required escrow deposit amount on or before the due date for
deposits for that quarter under subdivision (2) of section 69-2703 shall be
excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction. To the
extent a stamping agent makes payments with respect to a shortfall amount
under this subsection, such stamping agent shall have a claim against the
nonparticipating manufacturer for such amount.</para><para>(3) A stamping agent shall
