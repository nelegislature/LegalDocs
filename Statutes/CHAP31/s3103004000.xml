All such objections shall be heard by the court in a summary manner, without any unnecessary delay, and in case such objections are overruled, the district court shall, by its order duly entered of record, declare the drainage district a public corporation of this state. The fact that the district contains one hundred and sixty acres or more of wet, overflowed, or submerged lands shall be sufficient cause for declaring the public utility of such improvements, and shall be sufficient grounds for declaring the organization of a public corporation of this state. In case any owner of such real estate shall satisfy the court that his real estate, or a part thereof, has been wrongfully included in the district, and will not be benefited thereby, then the court may exclude such real estate as will not be benefited, and declare the remainder a district as prayed for.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1905, c. 161, &#167; 3, p. 612; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 1799; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 1746; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 31-403; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 31-304.</para></source><annotation><para>District was organized properly.
