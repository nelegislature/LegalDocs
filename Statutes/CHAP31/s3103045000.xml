In the same resolution the board shall provide that in due time, manner and season it will cause the annual levy to be made in compliance with such resolution, and thereupon the fund, to the extent that it may be necessary to pay the bonds, shall be pledged and hypothecated to the payment of the bonds, which pledge and hypothecation, to the amount so expressed and declared, shall be superior to any other charge against the same.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1909, c. 149, &#167; 1, p. 528; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 1840; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 1787; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 31-444; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 31-345.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
