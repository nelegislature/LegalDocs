Upon such roll the real estate and the amounts of the several assessments may be described by current and usual abbreviations, if the board so desires. Thereupon the board shall proceed to enter judgment by confirmation upon such supplemental assessment roll, and such supplemental assessments shall be levied and certified in all respects as provided for herein. From time to time, and as often as occasion may arise, supplemental assessments may be levied as in this section provided. In the event that any supplemental assessment is levied before any bonds are issued by the district, it shall be divided into installments, payable when the installments of the first original assessment are payable, and shall be collected therewith, and together they shall constitute one fund against which drainage bonds may be issued as herein provided.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1909, c. 149, &#167; 2, p. 529; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 1829; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 1776; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 31-433; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 31-334.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
