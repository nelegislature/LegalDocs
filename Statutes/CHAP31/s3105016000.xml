Notice of such meeting of the board of equalization shall be given by publishing a notice thereof in a paper, published in the county seat in each of the counties where any of the lands to be assessed are situated, once each week for three consecutive weeks. Appeals from the findings of such board of equalization may be taken in the manner provided for appeals from assessments of drainage districts organized under sections 31-401 to 31-450.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1927, c. 144, &#167; 2, p. 392; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 31-612; </para><para>Laws 1933, c. 136, &#167; 26, p. 539; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 31-612; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 31-516; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 900, &#167; 74. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Appeals,</emphasis> see section 31-412.</para></crossreference></law></legaldoc>
