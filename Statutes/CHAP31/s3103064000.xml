All such annual assessments shall be based upon the original apportionment of benefits to the lands and property within the district, and apportioned as the original assessment. The board of supervisors shall also determine and certify to the said authorities at that time the amount each tract of land or separate property shall pay as its proportion of the funds so found necessary, and levied for said purposes.
