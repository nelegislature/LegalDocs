<para>Each political party shall hold a state postprimary convention biennially
on a date to be fixed by the state central committee but not later than September
1. Candidates for elective offices may be nominated at such conventions pursuant to section 32-627 or 32-721.
Such nominations shall be certified to the Secretary of State by the chairperson
and secretary of the convention. The certificates shall have the same force
and effect as nominations in primary elections. A political party may not nominate a candidate at the convention
for an office for which the party did not nominate a candidate at the primary
election except as provided for new political parties in section 32-621. The
convention shall formulate and promulgate a state platform, select a state
central committee, select electors for President and Vice President of the
United States, and transact the business which is properly before it. One
presidential elector shall be chosen from each congressional district, and
two presidential electors shall be chosen at large. The officers of the convention
shall certify the names of the electors to the Governor and Secretary of State.</para>
