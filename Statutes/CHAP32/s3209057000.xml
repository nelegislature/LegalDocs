ballot under section 32-953 shall be counted only if it is returned in the
identification envelope, the envelope is signed by the voter to whom it was
issued, and the signature is verified by the election commissioner or county
clerk. The election commissioner or county clerk shall verify the signature
on each identification envelope received in his or her office with the signature
appearing on the voter registration records. If the election commissioner
or county clerk is unable to verify a signature, the election commissioner
or county clerk shall contact the voter within two days after determining
that he or she is unable to verify the signature to ascertain whether the
voter cast a ballot. The election commissioner or county clerk may request
that the registered voter sign and submit a current signature card pursuant
to section 32-318. The election commissioner or county clerk may begin verifying
the signatures as the envelopes are received in his or her office. If the
election commissioner or county clerk determines that a voter has voted more
than once, no ballot cast by that voter in that election shall be counted.
The election commissioner or county clerk shall make public any record or list of registered
voters who have returned their ballots.</para>
