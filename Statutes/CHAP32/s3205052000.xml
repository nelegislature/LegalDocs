district boundaries; (iv) the Secretary of State and such election commissioner
shall also have available for viewing on his or her web site the map referred
to in subdivision (a)(i) of this subsection identifying the boundaries for
such election districts; and (v) the twelve numbered districts in existence

be practical. The election commissioner shall adjust the boundaries of such
