<para>If any person nominated for elective office for the general election notifies the filing
officer with whom the candidate filing form or other acceptance of nomination
was filed by filing a statement, in writing and duly acknowledged, that he
or she declines such nomination on or before September 1 before the election,
the person's name shall not be printed on the ballot, but no declination shall
be effective after such date. The filing officer shall inform one or more
persons whose names are attached to the nomination if the candidate was nominated
by a political party convention or committee or, if nominated at a primary
election, the chairperson or secretary of the campaign or political party
committee of his or her political party if there is one within the jurisdiction of the filing officer and,
if not, at least three of the prominent members of the candidate's political
party within the jurisdiction of the filing
officer that such candidate has declined the nomination by mailing
or delivering to them personally notice of such fact. Such declination shall create a vacancy on the ballot
which may be filled pursuant to section 32-627. In lieu
of filing a declination with the Secretary of State, the person so nominated
may file a declination with the election commissioner or county clerk in the
county in which he or she resides. Any election commissioner or county clerk
receiving such a declination shall within five days after its receipt forward
a copy of the written declination statement to the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State shall make notifications required by this section for all
individuals for whom he or she receives a copy of the written declination
statement.</para>
