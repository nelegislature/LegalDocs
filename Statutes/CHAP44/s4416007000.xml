This provision shall not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon provisions in the policy that relate to eligibility for coverage;</para><para>(3) A provision that a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder shall be attached to the policy when issued, that all statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured shall be deemed representations and not

event of death or incapacity of the insured person, to his or her beneficiary or personal representative;</para><para>(4) A provision setting forth the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to furnish evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the insurer as a condition to part or all of his or her coverage;</para><para>(5) A provision specifying that an equitable adjustment of premiums, of benefits, or of both is to be made in the event the age of a person insured has been misstated, such provision to contain a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used;</para><para>(6) A provision that any sum becoming due by reason of the death of the person insured shall be payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured, except that if the policy contains conditions pertaining to family status, the beneficiary may be the family member specified by the policy terms,

for delivery to each person insured an individual certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which he or she is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable, a statement as to any dependent's coverage included in the certificate, and the rights and conditions set forth in subdivisions (8), (9), and (10) of this section;</para><para>(8) A provision that if the insurance, or any portion of it, on a person covered under the policy ceases because of termination of employment or of membership in the class or classes eligible for coverage under the policy, such person shall be entitled to have issued to him or her by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of life insurance without disability or other supplementary benefits if application for the individual policy is made and the first premium paid to the insurer within thirty-one days after such termination and if (a) the individual policy shall, at the option of such person, be on any one of the forms customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for, except that the group policy may exclude the option to elect term insurance, (b) the individual policy shall be in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of such termination, less the amount of any life insurance for which the person becomes eligible under the same or any other group policy within thirty-one days after termination, except that any amount of insurance which shall have matured on or before the date of such termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments or in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this subdivision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of such termination, (c) the premium on the individual policy shall be at the insurer's then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which such person then belongs, and to his or her age attained on the effective date of the individual policy, and (d) subject to the conditions set forth in subdivisions (8)(a)

under the group policy that terminates by reason of death and (ii) to the dependent of the employee or member upon termination of coverage of the dependent, while the employee or member remains insured under the group policy, by reason of the dependent ceasing to be a qualified family member under the group policy;</para><para>(9) A provision that if the group policy terminates or is amended so as to terminate the insurance of any class of insured persons, every person insured thereunder at the date of such termination whose insurance terminates, including the insured dependent of a covered person, and who has been so insured for at least five years prior to such termination date shall be entitled to have issued to him or her by the insurer an individual policy of life insurance, subject to the same conditions and limitations as are provided by subdivision (8) of this section, except that the group policy may provide that the amount of such individual policy shall not exceed the smaller of the amount of the person's life insurance protection ceasing because of the termination or amendment of the group policy, less the amount of any life insurance for which he or she is or becomes eligible under any group policy issued or reinstated by the same or another insurer within thirty-one days after such termination, and ten thousand dollars;</para><para>(10) A provision that if a person insured under the group policy or the insured dependent of a covered person dies during the period within which he or she would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued to him or her in accordance with subdivision (8) or (9) of this section and before such an individual policy shall have become effective, the amount of life insurance which he or she would have been entitled to have issued to him or her under such individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium therefor has been made;</para><para>(11) If active employment is a condition of insurance, a provision that an insured may continue coverage during the insured's total disability by timely payment to the policyholder of that portion, if any, of the premium that would have been required from the insured had total disability not occurred. The continuation shall be on a premium-paying basis for a period of six months from the date on which the total disability started, but not beyond the earlier of:</para><para>(a) Approval by the insurer of continuation of the coverage under any disability provision which the group insurance policy may contain; or</para><para>(b) The discontinuance of the group insurance policy; and</para><para>(12) In the case of a policy insuring the lives of debtors, a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a certificate of insurance describing the coverage and specifying that any death benefit shall first be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1949, c. 150, &#167; 2, p. 383; </para><para>Laws 1957, c. 192, &#167; 7, p. 677; </para><para>Laws 1989, LB 92, &#167; 177; </para><para>Laws 2008, LB855, &#167; 16.</para></source>  </law></legaldoc>
