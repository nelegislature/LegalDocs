The Legislature further finds that because policyholders of a mutual insurer have membership interests in the mutual insurer, the director should have broad authority in reviewing a reorganization and the procedures and criteria to be applied by the director should be flexible within the parameters of the Mutual Insurance Holding Company Act. The act shall be liberally construed to effect the legislative intent set forth in this section and shall not be interpreted to limit the powers granted to the director by other provisions of the law.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 740, &#167; 2. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
