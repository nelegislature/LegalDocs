The notice shall be sent by first-class mail to the last address contained in the agent's records to each policyholder or other person named in any policy issued through the agent by the insurer if he or she has a record of the address of the policyholder or other person. A policy shall be deemed issued through an agent if the agent has a property interest in the expiration of the policy or if the agent has had in his or her possession a copy of the declarations of the policy at any time during the life of the policy except when the ownership of the expiration of the policy has been transferred to another. The written notice shall include the name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the agent, identification of the policy impaired, and the nature of the impairment, including termination of coverage as described in section 44-4819.
