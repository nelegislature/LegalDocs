<annotation><para>The language in this section referring to notice to "all interested parties" contemplates notice by the Nebraska Department of Insurance to both the insured and the insurer regarding the adversarial proceeding to come. It would not be a sensible reading of the statutes to require notice to only one of the parties, where both parties are active in the proceeding but seek different outcomes. Travelers Indem. Co. v.
