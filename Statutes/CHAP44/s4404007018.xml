For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. In no event shall the present value of paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1979, LB 354, &#167; 14. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
