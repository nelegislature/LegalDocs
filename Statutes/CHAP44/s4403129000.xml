Improved access to health care services by segments of the population which desire such services can provide beneficial social and health consequences which may be in the public interest.</para><para>The cost ramifications of expanding health care coverages and services are a growing concern. The structures of such coverages or services and the steps taken to create incentives to provide cost-effective services or to take advantage of cost-offsetting features of services can significantly influence the cost impact of mandating particular coverages and services.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1986, LB 895, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
