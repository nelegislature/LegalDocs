Such agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and</para><para>(f) Other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated in this section, as considered necessary by the director.</para><para>(10) If the director acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the director may reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor if:</para><para>(a) The director's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state; and</para><para>(b) The regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the director's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other international insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the director may refuse recognition and cooperation.</para><para>(11) The director may enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under section 44-2132, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the international insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.</para><para>(12) A registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the director's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and any other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2016, LB772, &#167; 13. </para></source></law>
