If such proof is supplied and if pool coverage is applied for under the Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool Act within sixty days after the involuntary termination and if premiums are paid to the pool for the entire coverage period, any waiting period or preexisting condition exclusions provided for under the pool coverage shall be waived to the extent similar exclusions, if any, under the previous health coverage have been satisfied and the effective date of the pool coverage shall be the day following termination of the previous health coverage.

If premiums are paid to the pool for the entire coverage period, the effective date of the pool coverage shall be the day following termination of the previous coverage under the continuation-of-coverage policy or contract.
