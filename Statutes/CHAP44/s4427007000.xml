For purposes of this section, coverage date means the date on which the association becomes responsible for the obligations of a member insurer. The election shall be effected by the association, or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations on behalf of the association, sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers. To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available upon request to the association, or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations on behalf of the association, as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed, and notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts.

The receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contract with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date, subject to applicable setoff provisions; and</para><para>(d) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in subdivision (13) of this section, nothing in such subdivision shall alter or modify the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract. Nothing in the subdivision shall abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract. Nothing in such subdivision shall give a policyowner, contract owner, enrollee, certificate holder, or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. Nothing in this section shall apply to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks;</para><para>(14) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of the act in an economical and efficient manner;</para><para>(15) If the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of the act to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under the act, such person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement; and</para><para>(16) Venue in an action against the association arising under the act shall be in the district court of Lancaster County. The association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under the act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1975, LB 217, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 593, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 360, &#167; 16; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 216, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 2019, LB159, &#167; 4. </para></source><annotation><para>This section does not encompass the liability of an insolvent insurer arising under law rather than under the provisions of the policy such insurer issued.
