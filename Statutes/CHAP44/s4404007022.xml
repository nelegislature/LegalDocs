Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 44-407.16 to 44-407.19 and 44-407.21, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of total and permanent disability, (2) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (3) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by sections 44-407.10 to 44-407.22. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1979, LB 354, &#167; 18. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
