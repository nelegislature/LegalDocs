In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carryforward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</para><para>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the director's approval thereof, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until (a) the director has approved the payment of such a dividend or distribution or (b) the director has not disapproved such payment within the thirty-day period referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1991, LB 236, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 689, &#167; 3. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
