or</para><para>(ii) The non-United-States jurisdiction, if such jurisdiction has no United States insurance groups operating in such jurisdiction, indicates formally in writing to the lead state with a copy to the International Association of Insurance Supervisors that the group capital calculation is an acceptable international capital standard. Such writing will serve as the documentation otherwise required in subdivision (15)(a)(i) of this section; or</para><para>(b) The non-United-States jurisdiction provides confirmation by a competent regulatory authority in such jurisdiction that information regarding insurers and their parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entities, if applicable, shall be provided to the director or commissioner of the lead state in accordance with a memorandum of understanding or similar document between the director and such jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding or other multilateral memoranda of understanding coordinated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

The list will clarify those situations in which a jurisdiction is exempt from filing under subdivision (13)(a)(iv) of this section. To assist with a determination under subdivision (13)(b) of this section, the list will also identify whether a jurisdiction that is exempt under subdivision (13)(a)(iii) or (iv) of this section requires a group capital filing for any United-States-based insurance group's operations in that non-United-States jurisdiction.</para><para>(c) For a non-United-States jurisdiction where no United States insurance groups operate, the confirmation provided to meet the requirement of subdivision (15)(a)(ii) of this section will serve as support for a recommendation that such non-United-States jurisdiction be published as a jurisdiction that recognizes and accepts the group capital calculation through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee process.</para><para>(d) If the director or commissioner of the lead state makes a determination pursuant to subdivision (13)(a)(iv) of this section that differs from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners list, the director or commissioner of the lead state shall provide thoroughly documented justification to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and other states.</para><para>(e) Upon determination by the director or commissioner of the lead state that a non-United-States jurisdiction no longer meets one or more of the requirements to recognize and accept the group capital calculation, the director or commissioner of the lead state may provide a recommendation to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that the non-United-States jurisdiction be removed from the list of jurisdictions that recognize and accept the group capital calculation.</para><para>(17)(a) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer that is subject to registration and scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework shall file the results of a specific data year's liquidity stress test.

Similarly, insurers that do not meet at least one threshold of the scope criteria shall be considered scoped out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data year unless the director or commissioner of the lead state, in consultation with the Financial Stability Task Force or any successor to the task force, determines the insurer should be scoped into the framework for that data year.</para><para>(c) In order for regulators to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis, the director or commissioner of the lead state, in consultation with the Financial Stability Task Force or any successor to the task force, shall assess this concern as part of the determination for an insurer.</para><para>(d) The performance of, and filing of the results from, a liquidity stress test for a specific data year shall comply with the instructions and reporting templates for the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for such data year and any determinations made by the director or commissioner of the lead state, in consultation with the Financial Stability Task Force or any successor to the task force, provided within the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework.</para><para>(18) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement thereto or enterprise risk report required by this section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of this section.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1991, LB 236, &#167; 12; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 689, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 119, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 2012, LB887, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 2022, LB863, &#167; 22. </para><operativedate>July 21, 2022</operativedate></source></law>
