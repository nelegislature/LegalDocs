is not involved, shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the consumer's suitability information.</para>
<para>(3) Except as expressly
permitted under subsection (4) of this section, an insurer shall not issue

believe the annuity is suitable based on the consumer's suitability information.</para>
<para>(4)(a) Except as provided
under subdivision (4)(b) of this section, neither
an insurance producer, nor an insurer, shall
have any obligation to a consumer under subsection (1) or (3) of this section related to any annuity transaction if:</para>

subsection (1) of this section;</para><para>(b) Obtain a customer-signed statement documenting
a customer's refusal to provide suitability information, if any; and</para>

features of its annuity products to its insurance producers;</para>
<para>(iv) The insurer shall
maintain procedures for review of each recommendation prior to issuance of
an annuity that are designed to ensure that there is a reasonable basis to
determine that a recommendation is suitable. Such review procedures may apply
a screening system for the purpose of identifying selected transactions for
additional review and may be accomplished electronically or through other
means including, but not limited to, physical review. Such an electronic or
other system may be designed to require additional review only of those transactions
identified for additional review by the selection criteria;</para>
