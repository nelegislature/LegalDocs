and declarations.</catchline><para>The Legislature finds and declares
that there is a significant number of Nebraskans
who lack health insurance and that these uninsured people include many individuals and families who cannot afford
the rising cost of medical care but do not qualify for the various income-based
assistance programs. The lack of financial means of uninsured people and families to pay for their
medical care leaves health care providers with uncollectible debts which are
transferred to other patients and to insurers. It is the purpose and intent
of the Legislature to provide a mechanism to allow insurers to provide basic
levels of health insurance to those people who are uninsured and are not
qualified for income-based assistance programs.</para>
