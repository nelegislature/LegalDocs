Such fee shall not exceed twelve and one-half percent of the amount which the court or jury finds the plaintiff is entitled to recover against the insurer, but in no event shall such fee be less than twenty-five dollars. Failure of an insurer to defend any such action shall be deemed prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was vexatious and without reasonable cause.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1949, c. 134, &#167; 4, p. 352; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1988), &#167; 44-137.07. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
