Special meetings of the shareholders or members may be held as may be provided in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws and as otherwise provided by law.

A shareholder or member may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or member or by his or her duly authorized attorney in fact appointing any director, officer, shareholder, or member for such purpose. In the case of a mutual company or an assessment association, such proxy may be incorporated into a member's application for insurance or policy. All such proxies shall be filed or on file with the stock or mutual company or assessment association at least five days prior to the day of the meeting, and they shall expire eleven months from their effective date, unless otherwise provided in such proxy, application, or policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or limit the right of a shareholder or member to vote in person or otherwise revoke any such proxy at any time prior to any exercise thereof. In the case of a mutual company or an assessment association, there shall be no quorum requirements for any meeting of members except as set forth in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of such mutual company or assessment association.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1913, c. 154, &#167; 63, p. 422; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 3199; </para><para>Laws 1919, c. 190, tit.
