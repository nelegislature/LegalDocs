how determined.</catchline><para>(1)(a) For
calendar years prior to January 1, 2010, rates and rate schedules
may be adjusted for appropriate risk factors such as age, sex, and area variation
in claim costs in accordance with established actuarial and underwriting practices.
Special rates shall be provided for children under eighteen years of age.</para>
<para>(b) For calendar years prior to January
1, 2010, the pool, with the assistance of an independent actuary,
shall determine the standard risk rate by calculating the average individual
rate charged by the five insurers writing the largest amount of individual
health insurance coverage in the state actuarially adjusted to be comparable
with the pool coverage, except that such five insurers shall not include any
insurer which has not been writing individual health insurance coverage in
this state in at least the three preceding calendar years. The selection of
the independent actuary shall be subject to the approval of the director.
In the event five insurers do not offer comparable coverage, the standard
risk rate shall be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and shall
reflect anticipated risk experience and expenses for such coverage. The annual
premium rate established for pool coverage shall be one hundred thirty-five
percent of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks,
except that the annual premium rate established for pool coverage for children
under eighteen years of age shall be sixty-seven and five-tenths percent of
rates established as applicable for individual standard risks. </para>

not include any insurer which has not been writing individual health insurance
coverage in this state in at least the three preceding calendar years. The

factors as the board deems appropriate, whichever is greater.</para>
<para>(B) The annual premium rate established
for pool coverage for calendar year 2011 (I) shall be one hundred forty-five
percent of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks or

<para>(C) The annual premium rate established
for pool coverage for calendar year 2012 and each calendar year thereafter
