A reciprocal doing business in this state on August 25, 1989, shall not be subject to the foregoing deposit requirement insofar as such requirement would increase the amount of deposit necessary for the issuance of contracts on those classes of insurance being issued by it on such date, except that if such reciprocal, on and after such date, is determined by the director to be maintaining an amount which complies with such deposit requirement, then such reciprocal shall continue to be subject to such requirement. On and after such date, any reciprocal desiring to write any additional line of insurance as specified in section 44-201 shall thereupon deposit and maintain funds of at least one million dollars as provided in this section. This section shall be applicable to a reciprocal exchange issuing assessable or nonassessable policy contracts or agreements.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1917, c. 189, &#167; 3, p. 459; </para><para>Laws 1919, c. 190, tit.
