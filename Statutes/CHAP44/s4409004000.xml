Establishing a customer relationship is not at the customer's election if a licensee acquires or is assigned a customer's policy from another financial institution or residual market mechanism and the customer does not have a choice about the licensee's acquisition or assignment.</para><para>(b) A licensee may provide the initial notice required by subdivision (1)(a) of this section within a reasonable time after the licensee establishes a customer relationship if providing notice not later than when the licensee establishes a customer relationship would substantially delay the customer's transaction and the customer agrees to receive the notice at a later time. Providing notice not later than when a licensee establishes a customer relationship substantially delays the customer's transaction when the licensee and the individual agree over the telephone to enter into a customer relationship involving prompt delivery of the insurance product or service. Providing notice not later than when a licensee establishes a customer relationship does not substantially delay the customer's transaction when the relationship is initiated in person at the licensee's office or through other means by which the customer may view the notice, such as on a website.</para><para>(6) When a licensee is required to deliver an initial privacy notice by this section, the licensee shall deliver it according to section 44-909. If the licensee uses a short form initial notice for noncustomers according to subsection (4) of section 44-906, the licensee may deliver its privacy notice according to subdivision (4)(c) of section 44-906.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2001, LB 52, &#167; 4. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
