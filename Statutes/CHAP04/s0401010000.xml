<para>The Legislature
finds that unborn children do not have immigration status and therefor are
not within the scope of section 4-108. Prenatal care services available pursuant
to sections 68-915 and 68-972 to unborn children, whose eligibility is independent
of the mother's eligibility status, shall not be deemed to be tied to the
immigration status of the mother and therefor are not included in the restrictions
imposed by section 4-108.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2009, LB403, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2012, LB599, &#167; 1.</para></source>  </law>
