shall cause the sheriff to serve a copy of the recorded lien upon the owner
of the real property upon which the nonconsensual common-law lien is recorded
and the sheriff shall make return thereof without delay by filing proof of
service with the register of deeds as provided in subsection (1) of section

judicial proceeding to enforce a nonconsensual common-law lien shall be instituted
