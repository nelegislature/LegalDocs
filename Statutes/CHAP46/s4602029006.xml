If the director determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the rate determined by the director to be necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2004, LB 962, &#167; 10. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
