<para>(1)(a) Whenever the Department of Natural Resources has designated
a river basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated or has made a final
determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated,
the natural resources districts encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or
reach and the department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed, adopted,
and take effect within three years after such designation or final determination
unless the department and the natural resources districts jointly agree to
an extension of not more than two additional years.</para>
<para>(b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or has
not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly with the
department, develop an integrated management plan for such river basin, subbasin,
or reach located within the district. The district shall notify the department
of its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be developed
and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and subsections (1) and
(2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated management plan under
this subdivision is to manage such river basin, subbasin, or reach to achieve
and sustain a balance between water uses and water supplies for the long term.
If a district develops an integrated management plan under this subdivision
and the department subsequently determines the affected river basin, subbasin,
or reach to be fully appropriated, the department and the affected natural
resources district may amend the integrated management plan.</para>
<para>(2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects
of existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water appropriators
and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated management plan
shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and objectives with a purpose
of sustaining a balance between water uses and water supplies so that the
economic viability, social and environmental health, safety, and welfare of
the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be achieved and maintained for both
the near term and the long term; (b) a map clearly delineating the geographic
area subject to the integrated management plan; (c) one or more of the ground
water controls authorized for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant
to section 46-739; (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized
for adoption by the department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a plan
to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that could be
used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase understanding of the
surface water and hydrologically connected ground water system, and test the
validity of the conclusions and information upon which the integrated management
plan is based. The plan may also provide for utilization of any applicable
incentive programs authorized by law. Nothing in the integrated management
plan for a fully appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require
a natural resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the
time of the department's preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin,
or reach is fully appropriated, unless
such regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-wide
plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources district
may decide to include all water users within the district boundary in an integrated
management plan.</para>
<para>(3) In order to provide a process for economic development
opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and transparent
procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows resulting from new,
retired, or other changes to uses within the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
The procedures shall:</para>
<para>(a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the
best available information, data, and science;</para>
<para>(b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized
to estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to new
uses;</para>
<para>(c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not
have more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
water users;</para>
<para>(d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and
the department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share information
on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting water use in the
river basin, subbasin, or reach;</para>
<para>(e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available
to mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use management,
and use retirement;</para>
<para>(f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans
after consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts, municipalities,
other political subdivisions, and other water users to make water available
for offset to enhance and encourage economic development opportunities and
economic sustainability in the river basin, subbasin, or reach; and</para>
<para>(g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses
shall take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.</para>
<para>Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment
of an integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.</para>
<para>(4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed
for adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1)
of this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable incentive
programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of the plan, (b)
be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in compliance with applicable
state and federal laws and with any applicable interstate water compact or
decree or other formal state contract or agreement pertaining to surface water
or ground water use or supplies, and (c) protect the ground water users whose
water wells are dependent on recharge from the river or stream involved and
the surface water appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion
caused by surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a
river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713, after
the date of such designation or preliminary determination.</para>
<para>(5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated
as overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more natural
resources districts, the department and the affected natural resources districts
shall jointly develop a basin-wide plan for the area designated as overappropriated.
Such plan shall be developed using the consultation and collaboration process
described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently
with the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to achieve,
in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this subsection,
the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this section. The
basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the department and the
affected natural resources districts.</para>
<para>(b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the department and each natural
resources district encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach shall
jointly develop an integrated management plan for such river basin, subbasin,
or reach pursuant to subsections (1) through (4) of this section. Each integrated
management plan for a river basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection
shall be consistent with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision
(a) of this subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed
after consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation companies,
canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from within the affected
area and that, after being notified of the commencement of the plan development
process, indicate in writing their desire to participate in such process.
In addition, the department or the affected natural resources districts may
include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration process,
the department and each natural resources district shall adopt the agreed-upon
integrated management plan. If agreement cannot be reached by all parties
involved, the integrated management plan shall be developed and adopted by
the department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to sections
46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to section
46-719.</para>
<para>(c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully appropriated
levels of development. Such determination shall take into account cyclical
supply, including drought, identify the portion of the overall difference
between the current and fully appropriated levels of development that is due
to conservation measures, and identify the portions of the overall difference
between the current and fully appropriated levels of development that are
due to water use initiated prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated
on or after such date.</para>
<para>(d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives identified
under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following steps:</para>
<para>(i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact
of streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1, 1997,
and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river basin, subbasin,
or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow depletions that would
cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such interstate cooperative agreement.
During the first increment, the department and the affected natural resources
districts shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability
of funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior to
such date. The department and the affected natural resources districts may
also use other appropriate and authorized measures for such purpose;</para>
<para>(ii) The department and the affected natural resources districts
may amend an integrated management plan subject to this subsection (5) as
necessary based on an annual review of the progress being made toward achieving
the goals for that increment;</para>
<para>(iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten years
after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated management
plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the department and
the affected natural resources district shall conduct a technical analysis
of the actions taken in such increment to determine the progress towards meeting
the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.
The analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and changes
in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation practices and natural
causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and (C) the effects of the
plan on reducing the overall difference between the current and fully appropriated
levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The
analysis shall determine whether a subsequent increment is necessary in the
integrated management plan to meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant
to subsection (2) of this section and reduce the overall difference between
the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
(5)(c) of this section;</para>
<para>(iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii)
of this subsection, the department and the affected natural resources districts,
utilizing the consultative and collaborative process described in subdivision
(b) of this subsection, shall if necessary identify goals for a subsequent
increment of the integrated management plan. Subsequent increments shall be
completed, adopted, and take effect not more than ten years after adoption
of the previous increment; and</para>
<para>(v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the department and
the affected natural resources districts agree that the goals and objectives
identified pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been met and the
overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of development
identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that
the river basin, subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.</para>
<para>(6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated
as fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
formal state contract or agreement, the department, in consultation with the
affected districts, shall forecast on an annual basis the maximum amount of
water that may be available from streamflow for beneficial use in the short
term and long term in order to comply with the requirement of subdivision
(4)(b) of this section. This forecast shall be made by January 1, 2008, and
each January 1 thereafter.</para>
