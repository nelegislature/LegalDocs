It shall be the duty of the directors to make all necessary arrangements for right-of-way for laterals from the main canal to each tract of land subject to assessment, and when necessary the board shall exercise its right of eminent domain to procure right-of-way for the laterals and shall make such rules in regard to the payment for such right-of-way as may be just and equitable.</para><para>(3) In times of reduced water supply, when the volume of water is not adequate to be beneficially used when equitably apportioned to all landowners in the district, the board may, after providing notice to landowners in a portion of the district and upon receiving no objections from the majority of such landowners, elect not to deliver water to that portion of the district. Such election shall not subject the district to liability under section 46-160 and shall not affect the rights of landowners in that portion of the district to water deliveries in the future. Any election to not deliver water to a portion of the district shall be made on a year-to-year basis, not to exceed ten years, and such election shall not subject any landowner to adjudication of his or her water right under section 46-229. The board may adjust the tolls or charges made to landowners within the district to reflect the decrease in supply to those landowners in the portion of the district not receiving water pursuant to such election by the board.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1895, c. 70, &#167; 9, p. 276; </para><para>Laws 1909, c. 156, &#167; 1, p. 566; </para><para>Laws 1911, c. 158, &#167; 1, p. 525; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 3465; </para><para>Laws 1915, c. 69, &#167; 2, p. 172; </para><para>Laws 1917, c. 82, &#167; 1, p. 194; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 2865; </para><para>Laws 1923, c. 97, &#167; 2, p. 247; </para><para>Laws 1927, c. 142, &#167; 1, p. 386; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 46-109; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 46-122; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 21, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 99, &#167; 13; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 900, &#167; 87; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 619, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2025, LB317, &#167; 62. </para><operativedate>July 1, 2025</operativedate></source><annotation><para>By this section the Legislature intended that subirrigated lands having no use for water should not be charged with operating expense.
