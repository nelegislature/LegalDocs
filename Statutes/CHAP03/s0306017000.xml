All bonds shall be general obligations of the authority issuing the same and shall be payable out of any revenue, income, receipts, profits, or other money of the authority, unless the authority shall expressly provide otherwise in the resolution authorizing their issuance, in which event the bonds shall be limited obligations of the authority issuing the same and shall be payable only out of that part of the revenue, income, receipts, profits, or other money of the authority as shall be specified by the authority in such resolution.

Payment of such notes shall be made from any money or revenue which the authority may have available for such purpose or from the proceeds of the sale of bonds of the authority, or such notes may be exchanged for a like amount of such bonds. The authority may pledge such money or revenue of the authority, subject to prior pledges thereof, if any, for the payment of such notes, and may in addition secure the notes in the same manner as herein provided for bonds. All notes shall be issued and sold in the same manner as bonds, and any authority shall have power to make contracts for the future sale from time to time of notes on terms and conditions stated in such contracts, and the authority shall have power to pay such consideration as it shall deem proper for any commitments to purchase notes in the future. Such notes may also be collaterally secured by pledges and deposits with a bank or trust company, in trust for the payment of such notes, of bonds in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount of such notes and, in any event, in an amount deemed by the issuing authority sufficient to provide for the payment of the notes in full at the maturity thereof.

Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.</para><para>(6) Neither the members of a board nor any person executing bonds or notes shall be liable personally thereon or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.</para><para>(7) An authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of such authority. Any bonds so purchased may be held, canceled, or resold by the authority subject to and in accordance with any agreements with bondholders.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 141, &#167; 17, p. 657; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 1, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 307, &#167; 2.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
