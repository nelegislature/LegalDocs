adopted under the Airport
Zoning Act shall be reasonable and not impose any requirement
or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes
of the act. In determining what
regulations it may adopt, each political subdivision and joint airport zoning
board shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations
expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within
the airport hazard area, the character of the neighborhood, and the uses to which the property to be zoned
is put and adaptable. If an
airport layout plan has been submitted for approval to the Federal Aviation
Administration with a proposed instrument runway depicted thereon and such
airport layout plan is conditionally or unconditionally approved without such
proposed instrument runway, the political subdivision shall adopt or revise,
as necessary, airport zoning regulations to protect any approach zone for
a visual runway only.</para>
