As people consider where to live, access to sustainable water resources and outdoor recreational opportunities will be important considerations in making Nebraska a competitive choice for the future;</para><para>(6) The state's lakes and rivers help Nebraskans enjoy the water resources in our state and make Nebraska an even more attractive place to live and raise a family;</para><para>(7) The state's water resources provide economic benefits to the people, communities, and businesses of Nebraska by helping to attract visitors from other states and boosting local economies;</para><para>(8) In 2021, the Legislature passed LB406, which established the Statewide Tourism And Recreational Water Access and Resource Sustainability Special Committee of the Legislature.

Such a reservoir could be built without a dam of a Platte River channel and without negatively impacting any existing municipalities, their surrounding communities, or any economic development already occurring in such areas;</para><para>(10) It is in the public interest to construct a lake at or near this location. Such a lake would provide flood control by providing additional off-channel storage during flood events and public recreational opportunities that would benefit generations of Nebraskans, similar to the recreational opportunities provided by Lake McConaughy, Lewis and Clark Lake, and Eugene T. Mahoney State Park;</para><para>(11) In addition to the primary purposes of providing flood control and public recreational opportunities that will benefit the public, building a lake will provide the collateral benefit of economic development opportunities;</para><para>(12) It is in the public interest, and the purpose of the Jobs and Economic Development Initiative Act, that private parties contribute to the cost of constructing and developing the lake and that the state seek out donations and investments from private parties to fund such construction and development;</para><para>(13) It is in the public interest, and the purpose of the act, that the state (a) manage the construction and development of the lake in a manner that encourages private donations and investments, including through the use of public-private partnerships, (b) maintain sufficient oversight to protect the state's investment in the lake, and (c) retain ownership of the lake as an asset for Nebraskans; and</para><para>(14) It is in the public interest, and the purpose of the act, that the lake, and the land near or adjacent thereto, be developed in a thoughtful and planned manner by the state and be free from control of political subdivisions or municipalities to further the act's purposes of providing flood control, recreational opportunities, and orderly development of the project.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2022, LB1023, &#167; 2. </para><effectivedate>April 19, 2022</effectivedate></source></law>
