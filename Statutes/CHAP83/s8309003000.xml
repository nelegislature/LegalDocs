The department shall hire a reentry program administrator to develop and oversee the reentry program and additional staff as needed to implement the reentry program. The purpose of the reentry program is to facilitate a standard systemwide program of reentry for individuals leaving correctional facilities or transitioning off community supervision. The primary objectives of the reentry program are to reduce recidivism, to identify, assess, and provide treatment options for individuals with mental illness, to increase public safety, and to improve the overall transition of the individual from the criminal justice system into the community. Prior to the discharge of an individual from a department correctional facility, the department shall provide such individual with an opportunity to obtain a state identification card or renew a motor vehicle operator's license.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2014, LB907, &#167; 13; </para><para>Laws 2018, LB258, &#167; 1. </para><operativedate>July 1, 2020</operativedate></source></law>
