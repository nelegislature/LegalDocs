The refunding bonds may be issued and delivered at any time prior to the date of maturity or the redemption date of the bonds to be refunded that the school district determines to be in the best interest of the district. The proceeds derived from the sale of refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section may be invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States Government pending the time the proceeds are required for the purposes for which such refunding bonds were issued. To further secure the refunding bonds, the school district may enter into a contract with any bank or trust company, within or without the state, with respect to the safekeeping and application of the proceeds of the refunding bonds and the safekeeping and application of the earnings on the investment. Any outstanding bonds, which shall have been called for redemption and which have sufficient funds or obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States Government set aside in safekeeping to be applied for the complete payment of such bonds, interest thereon, and redemption premium, if any on the redemption date, shall not be considered as outstanding and unpaid bonds. All bonds issued under the provisions of sections 10-717 to 10-719 must, on their face, contain a clause that the district issuing such bonds shall have the right to redeem such bonds at the expiration of five years from the date of the issuance thereof.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1879, &#167; 1, p. 176; </para><para>Laws 1893, c. 32, &#167; 1, p. 360; </para><para>Laws 1905, c. 139, &#167; 1, p. 574; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 464; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 381; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 11-917; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 10-717; </para><para>Laws 1955, c. 16, &#167; 1, p. 86; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 51, &#167; 15, p. 282; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 313, &#167; 1.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
