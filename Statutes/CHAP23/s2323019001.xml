who has terminated employment and is not vested, the balance of the member's
employer account or employer cash balance account shall be forfeited. The
forfeited account shall be credited to the County Employees Retirement Fund
and shall first be used to meet the expense charges incurred by the retirement
board in connection with administering the retirement system, which charges
shall be credited to the County Employees Defined Contribution Retirement
Expense Fund, if the member participated in the defined contribution option,
or to the County Employees Cash Balance Retirement Expense Fund, if the member
participated in the cash balance option, and the remainder, if any, shall
then be used to restore employer accounts or employer cash balance accounts.
Except as provided in subsection
(3) of section 23-2310.04 and subdivision (4)(c) of section 23-2317,
no forfeited amounts shall be applied to increase the benefits any member
would otherwise receive under the County Employees Retirement Act.</para>
<para>(2)(a) If a member ceases to be an employee due to the termination
of his or her employment by the county and a grievance or other appeal of
the termination is filed, transactions involving forfeiture of his or her
employer account or employer cash balance account and, except as provided
in subdivision (b) of this subsection, transactions for payment of benefits
under sections 23-2315 and 23-2319 shall be suspended pending the final outcome
of the grievance or other appeal.</para>
<para>(b) If a member elects to receive benefits payable under
sections 23-2315 and 23-2319 after a grievance or appeal is filed, the member
may receive an amount up to the balance of his or her employee account or
member cash balance account or twenty-five thousand dollars payable from the
employee account or member cash balance account, whichever is less.</para>
<para>(3) The County Employer Retirement Expense Fund is created.
The fund shall be administered by the Public Employees Retirement Board. Prior
to July 1, 2012, the County Employer Retirement Expense Fund shall be used
to meet expenses of the retirement system whether such expenses are incurred
in administering the member's employer account or in administering the member's
employer cash balance account when the funds available in the County Employees
Defined Contribution Retirement Expense Fund or County Employees Cash Balance
Retirement Expense Fund make such use reasonably necessary. The County Employer
Retirement Expense Fund shall consist of any reduction in a county contribution
which would otherwise be required to fund future service retirement benefits
or to restore employer accounts or employer cash balance accounts referred
to in subsection (1) of this section. On July 1, 2012, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, any money in the County Employer Retirement Expense Fund shall
be transferred by the State Treasurer to the County Employees Retirement Fund
and credited to the cash balance benefit established in section 23-2308.01.</para>
<para>(4) Prior to July 1, 2012, expenses incurred as a result
of a county depositing amounts into the County Employer Retirement Expense
Fund shall be deducted prior to any additional expenses being allocated. Any
remaining amount shall be allocated in accordance with subsection (3) of this
section. Any money in the County Employer Retirement Expense Fund available
for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant
to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment
Act.</para>
