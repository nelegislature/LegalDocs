<para>(b) If a county on the day it first initiates a project for any of the

payable from its general fund levy, the county board may make an annual levy
of not to exceed five and two-tenths cents on each one hundred dollars upon
the taxable value of all the taxable property of the county for a project
or projects for any of the purposes specified in subsection (1) of this section
without the filing of a petition described in subdivision (3)(a) of this section.
The county board shall designate the particular project for which such levy

such project, and the number of cents of the levy for each year thereof. The
county board may designate more than one project and levy a tax pursuant to
this section for each such project, concurrently or consecutively, as the

will not exceed the limitations specified in this subsection. Each levy for
a project which is authorized by this subdivision may be imposed for such
duration specified by the county board notwithstanding the contemporaneous
existence or subsequent imposition of any other levy or levies for another
project or projects imposed pursuant to this subdivision and notwithstanding
the subsequent issuance by the county of bonded indebtedness payable from
its general fund levy.</para>
