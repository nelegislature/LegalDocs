The county board shall also have the power to sell or negotiate, without recourse upon the county, the notes and mortgages so taken; but they shall not be sold for less than par value including accrued interest. If, for any reason, such sale of the public grounds by a county board was irregular, illegal, or void, and the purchaser of such public grounds or his grantees have been in open, notorious, undisputed, continuous and adverse possession thereof for more than ten years, and during which ten years the county board has not refunded or offered to refund the purchase price, then in all such cases the county board is authorized and empowered and, when requested by the proper person, is required to convey to the purchaser of such grounds or his grantees, by good and sufficient deed without cost, the fee simple title to the public grounds so irregularly or illegally sold.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1879, &#167; 24, p. 360; </para><para>Laws 1887, c. 26, &#167; 1, p. 350; </para><para>Laws 1905, c. 44, &#167; 1, p. 287; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 952; </para><para>Laws 1915, c. 17, &#167; 1, p. 73; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 852; </para><para>Laws 1925, c. 93, &#167; 1, p. 273; </para><para>Laws 1929, c. 60, &#167; 2, p. 231; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 26-105; </para><para>Laws 1931, c. 40, &#167; 1, p. 134; </para><para>Laws 1933, c. 36, &#167; 1, p. 236; </para><para>Laws 1939, c. 28, &#167; 5, p. 144; </para><para>Laws 1941, c. 48, &#167; 2, p. 235; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 26-105; </para><para>Laws 1943, c. 57, &#167; 1(3), p. 224; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 23-107; </para><para>Laws 1961, c. 84, &#167; 1, p. 294; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 698, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 125, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1977, LB 363, &#167; 1. </para></source><annotation><para>This section is not applicable to property acquired under the Industrial Development Act of 1961.
