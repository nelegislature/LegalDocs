counties in this state in which a facility has been established as provided in section
23-3501 may, by a majority vote of the board, issue and sell bonds of the
county in such sums as the county board may deem advisable to defray the cost

date of issuance, (b) bear interest payable annually or semiannually, and
(c) contain an option to the county to pay all or any part thereof at any
time after five years after the date of issuance.
When such bonds have been issued under this section or section 23-3501, the
county board shall cause to be levied and collected annually a tax upon all
of the taxable property of such county sufficient to pay the interest and
principal of the bonds as the interest and principal become
due and payable. If the county
board deems it appropriate, the county board may submit to the electors of
such county at a general or special election the question of whether to exceed
the tax limitation set forth in Article VIII, section 5, of the Constitution
of Nebraska or any other applicable statutory levy limitation.</para>
