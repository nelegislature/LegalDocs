The court may restrain and permanently enjoin, where the facts indicate the necessity for such action on the basis of the public health and welfare, or, in the alternative, may impose such conditions on the holding of such exhibition, entertainment, or gathering, including the giving of a bond, as will adequately protect the public health and welfare or the health and welfare of those in attendance. The county board shall give such advance notice of the protest and of its hearing thereon as may be reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case, and the notice shall be given by the posting thereof at or immediately adjacent to the premises where such exhibition, entertainment, or gathering is to be held, and it may give such additional notice by publication, or by personal service or service by registered or certified mail on the owner, lessee, or occupant of the premises, or the promoter of such gathering or his agent, as the county board in its judgment may deem feasible.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1971, LB 63, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
