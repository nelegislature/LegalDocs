<para>(1)(a) Notices for management
of colonies shall consist of two kinds: General notice and individual notices,

general notice or to serve individual notices as provided in this section

Black-Tailed Prairie Dog Management Act.</para>
<para>(b) General notice shall
be published by the county board of each county that has adopted a coordinated
program for the management of black-tailed prairie dogs under section 23-3803

May 1 of each year or at such other times as the county board may determine.</para>
<para>(c) Whenever any county
board of a county that has adopted a coordinated program for the management
of black-tailed prairie dogs under section 23-3803 has reason to believe,
based upon information or through its own investigation, that a colony, or
any portion of a colony, has expanded onto adjacent property and the owner
of the adjacent property objects to such expansion and the county board determines
that it is necessary to secure more prompt or definite management of a colony
than is accomplished by the general published notice, it shall cause to be
served individual notice, upon the owner of record of the property upon which
the colony is located at his or her last-known address, of recommended methods
of when and how black-tailed prairie dogs are to be managed.</para>
