On such appeal the only questions that shall be tried shall be the questions raised before the board by the remonstrance. On such trial the report of the engineer shall be admissible in evidence and nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing or permitting the stoppage, prevention, or delay of the proposed work. If more than one party appeals, the appeals shall be consolidated and tried together and the rights of each appellant separately determined. If the court finds for any appellant upon his or her remonstrance, it shall amend the report and the schedule of the assessment in accordance with its finding. The amended report and schedule shall be filed with the county clerk and a copy forwarded to the Director-State Engineer. If on appeal the court finds against the remonstrants, it shall dismiss the appeal at the cost of appellant.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 269, &#167; 12, p. 897; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 1037; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 26-731; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 23-320; </para><para>Laws 1989, LB 26, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
