Therefore, the director may not issue permits which would jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species, or result in the destruction or modification of their habitat. Central Platte NRD v. City of Fremont, 250 Neb. 252, 549 N.W.2d 112 (1996).</para><para>Before authorizing a diversion project, the Department of Water Resources must consult with the Game and Parks Commission and must obtain an opinion as to whether the project will jeopardize threatened or endangered species. However, the opinion, merely by being issued, does not impose affirmative requirements upon an application. Central Platte NRD v. State of Wyoming, 245 Neb. 439, 513 N.W.2d 847 (1994).</para><para>If the director of the state Department of Water Resources, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, considers and relies on the opinion of the state Game and Parks Commission in making his or her decision about diversion of unappropriated waters, the applicant is affected by the statute and thus is entitled to challenge its constitutionality. This section does not violate the provisions of Article XV, sections 4, 5, and 6, of the Constitution of Nebraska. In re Applications A-10627 et al., 243 Neb. 419, 499 N.W.2d 548 (1993).</para><para>This section places two separate and distinct duties upon state departments and agencies, that of consultation with the Game and Parks Commission and, once done, an independent duty to insure that the actions they take or authorize do not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species or its habitat. Both the Department of Water Resources and the various natural resources districts are state departments or agencies within the meaning of this act. Little Blue N.R.D. v.
