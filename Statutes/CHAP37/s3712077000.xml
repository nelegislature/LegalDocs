person acquiring a motorboat from the owner thereof, whether the owner is
a manufacturer, importer, dealer, or otherwise, shall acquire any right, title,
claim, or interest in or to such motorboat until he or she has physical possession
of the motorboat and a certificate of title or a manufacturer's or importer's
certificate with assignments on the certificate to show title in the purchaser
or an instrument in writing required by section 37-1281. No waiver or estoppel
shall operate in favor of such person against a person having physical possession
of the motorboat and the certificate of title, the manufacturer's or importer's
certificate, or an instrument in writing required by section 37-1281. No court
