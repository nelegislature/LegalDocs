The application shall be signed and sworn to by the person making the application. The county clerk or designated county official, with the approval of the department, or the department shall issue a certified copy of the certificate of title to the person entitled to receive the certificate of title.

The new purchaser shall be entitled to receive an original title upon presentation of the assigned duplicate copy of the certificate of title, properly assigned to the new purchaser, to the county clerk or designated county official as prescribed in section 37-1278. Any purchaser of the motorboat may at the time of purchase require the seller of the motorboat to indemnify him or her and all subsequent purchasers of the motorboat against any loss which he, she, or they may suffer by reason of any claim presented upon the original certificate. In the event of the recovery of the original certificate of title by the owner, he or she shall immediately surrender the certificate to the county clerk, the designated county official, or the department for cancellation.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1994, LB 123, &#167; 12; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 464, &#167; 20. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
