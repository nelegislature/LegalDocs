a salvage motorboat through payment of a total loss settlement on account
of damage, the company shall obtain the certificate of title from the owner,
surrender such certificate of title to the county treasurer, and
make application for a salvage branded certificate of title which shall be
assigned when the company transfers ownership. An insurer shall take title
to a salvage motorboat for which a total loss settlement is made unless the
owner of the motorboat elects to retain the motorboat. If the owner elects
to retain the motorboat, the insurance company shall notify the Department
of Motor Vehicles of such fact in a format prescribed by the department. The
department shall immediately enter the salvage brand onto the computerized
record of the motorboat. The insurance company shall also notify the owner
of the owner's responsibility to comply with this section. The owner shall,
within thirty days after the settlement of the loss, forward the properly
endorsed acceptable certificate of title to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer shall,
upon receipt of the certificate of title, issue a salvage branded certificate
of title for the motorboat.</para>
