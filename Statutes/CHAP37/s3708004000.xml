The purpose of section 37-811 and section 77-27,119.01 is to provide a means by which such protection may be financed through a voluntary checkoff designation on state income tax return forms. The intent of the Legislature is that the program of income tax checkoff is supplemental to any funding and in no way is intended to take the place of the funding that would otherwise be appropriated for such purpose.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1984, LB 466, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1989, LB 258, &#167; 1; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1993), &#167; 37-432.01; </para><para>Laws 1998, LB 922, &#167; 354. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
