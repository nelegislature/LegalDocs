In re Application of George Farm Co., 233 Neb. 23, 443 N.W.2d 285 (1989).</para><para>The determination of what is economically sound under this section (formerly section 75-613) is peculiarly within the discretion and expertise of the Public Service Commission. Where the evidence is in conflict, the weight of the evidence is for the determination of the commission and not the appellate court. Reis v.

Note that this section was amended effective September 1, 2019, to place the focus on when the application to change exchange boundaries is filed, rather than whether service can be made available within a reasonable time.
