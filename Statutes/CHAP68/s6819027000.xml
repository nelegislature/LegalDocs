facilities from the quality assurance assessment and to permit other facilities
to pay the quality assurance assessment at lower rates.</para>

nursing facilities is approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
and the nursing facilities and skilled nursing facilities have been compensated
retroactively for the increased rate for services pursuant to section 68-1926.</para>
