<para>The Department
of Health and Human Services shall establish a program to provide amino acid-based
elemental formulas for the diagnosis and treatment of Immunoglobulin E and
non-Immunoglobulin E mediated allergies to multiple food proteins, food-protein-induced
enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic disorders, and impaired absorption of
nutrients caused by disorders affecting the absorptive surface, functional
length, and motility of the gastrointestinal tract, when the ordering physician
has issued a written order stating that the amino acid-based elemental formula
is medically necessary for the treatment of a disease or disorder. Up to fifty
percent of the actual out-of-pocket cost, not to exceed twelve thousand dollars,
for amino acid-based elemental formulas shall be available to an individual
without fees each twelve-month period. The department shall distribute funds
on a first-come, first-served basis. Nothing in this section is deemed to
be an entitlement. The maximum total General Fund expenditures per year for
amino acid-based elemental formulas shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousand
dollars each fiscal year in FY2014-15 and FY2015-16. The Department of Health
and Human Services shall provide an electronic report on the program to the
Legislature annually on or before December 15 of each year.</para>
