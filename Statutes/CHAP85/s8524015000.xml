to operate on a continuing basis shall be issued to the owner or governing
body of the postsecondary institution and shall be nontransferable. If there
is a change in ownership, as defined by the commission in rules and regulations,

shall terminate. An application for a new recurrent authorization
to operate may be deemed an application for renewal of the institution's original
authorization, except that
such renewal shall be given in the form of a recurrent authorization to operate
even if the original authorization was an authorization to operate on a continuing
basis. Verification
that all student records are transferred intact and in good condition to the
new owner shall accompany the application.</para>
