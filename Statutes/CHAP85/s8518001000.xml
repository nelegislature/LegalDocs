<para>The Legislature finds that the general welfare and well-being
of the state are directly related to educational levels and skills of the
citizens of the state and that a vital and valid public purpose is served
by the creation and implementation of programs which encourage and make possible
the attainment of higher education by the greatest number of citizens of the
state. The state has limited resources to provide additional programs for
higher education funding and the continued operation and maintenance of the
state's public institutions of higher education, and the general welfare of
the citizens of the state will be enhanced by establishing a program which
allows parents and others interested in the higher education of our youth
to invest money in a public trust for future application to the payment of qualified higher education expenses. The creation of the means of encouragement
for persons to invest in such a program represents the carrying out of a vital
and valid public purpose. In order to make available to parents and others
interested in the higher education of our youth an opportunity to fund future
higher education needs, it is necessary that a public trust be established
in which money may be invested for future educational use.</para>
