for the course or the student's failure to complete the course to the commission
within thirty days after the end of the course or within one hundred eighty
days after receipt of a payment pursuant to the act if the course for which
the scholarship was awarded does not have a specified ending date. The commission
shall keep the identity of students receiving scholarships confidential, except
