It is the intent and purpose of sections 85-1501 to 85-1540 to create locally governed and locally supported community college areas with the major educational emphasis on occupational education. Each community college area is intended to be an independent, local, unique, and vital segment of postsecondary education separate from both the established elementary and secondary school system and from other institutions of postsecondary education and is not to be converted into a four-year, baccalaureate-degree-granting institution.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1975, LB 344, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 802, &#167; 29; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 663, &#167; 44; </para><para>R.S.Supp.,1992, &#167; 79-2636; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 239, &#167; 23; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 269, &#167; 66. </para></source><annotation><para>Chapter 79, article 26, the Technical Community College Area Act, is not in violation of Article VIII, section 1A, of the Constitution.
