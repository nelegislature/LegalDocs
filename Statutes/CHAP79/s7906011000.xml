free transportation, partially provide free transportation, or pay an allowance
for transportation in lieu of free transportation as follows:</para>
<para>(a) When a student attends an elementary school in his or

own Class II or Class III school district and lives more than four miles from
the public schoolhouse as measured by the shortest route that must actually
and necessarily be traveled by motor vehicle to reach the student's residence.
This subdivision does not apply when one or more Class I school districts

district on or after January 1, 1997; and</para>
<para>(d) When a student, other than a student in grades ten through

in his or her own Class V district and lives more than four miles from the
public schoolhouse in such district as measured by the shortest route that

residence.</para>
<para>(2)(a) The school board of any school district that is a member
of a learning community shall provide free transportation for a student who
resides in such learning community and attends school in such school district
if (i) the student is transferring pursuant to the open enrollment provisions
of section 79-2110, qualifies for free or reduced-price lunches, lives more than one mile
from the school to which he or she transfers, and is not otherwise disqualified under subdivision (2)(c)
of this section, (ii) the student is transferring pursuant to the open enrollment provisions of section 79-2110, is a student who contributes
to the socioeconomic diversity of enrollment at the school building he or
she attends, lives
more than one mile from the school to which he or she transfers, and is not otherwise disqualified under
subdivision (2)(c) of this section, (iii) the student is attending
a focus school or program and lives more than one mile from the school building
housing the focus school or program, or (iv) the student is attending a magnet
school or program and lives more than one mile from the magnet school or the
school housing the magnet program.</para>
<para>(b) For purposes of this subsection, student who contributes
to the socioeconomic diversity of enrollment at the school building he or
she attends has the definition found in section 79-2110. This subsection does
not prohibit a school district that is a member of a learning community from
providing transportation to any intradistrict student.</para>
<para>(c) For any
student who resides within a learning community and transfers to another school
building pursuant to the open enrollment provisions of section 79-2110 and
who had not been accepted for open enrollment into any school building within
such district prior to September 6, 2013, the school board is exempt from
the requirement of subdivision (2)(a) of this section if (i) the student is
transferring to another school building within his or her home school district
or (ii) the student is transferring to a school building in a school district
that does not share a common border with his or her home school district.</para>
<para>(3) The transportation allowance which may be paid to the
parent, custodial parent, or guardian of students qualifying for free transportation
pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall equal two hundred
eighty-five percent of the mileage rate provided in section 81-1176, multiplied
by each mile actually and necessarily traveled, on each day of attendance,
beyond which the one-way distance from the residence of the student to the
schoolhouse exceeds three miles. Such
transportation allowance does not apply to students residing in a learning
community who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.</para>
<para>(4) Whenever students from more than one family travel to
school in the same vehicle, the transportation allowance prescribed in subsection
(3) of this section shall be payable as follows:</para>
<para>(a) To the parent, custodial parent, or guardian providing
transportation for students from other families, one hundred percent of the
amount prescribed in subsection (3) of this section for the transportation
of students of such parent's, custodial parent's, or guardian's own family
and an additional five percent for students of each other family not to exceed
a maximum of one hundred twenty-five percent of the amount determined pursuant
to subsection (3) of this section; and</para>
<para>(b) To the parent, custodial parent, or guardian not providing
transportation for students of other families, two hundred eighty-five percent
of the mileage rate provided in section 81-1176 multiplied by each mile actually
and necessarily traveled, on each day of attendance, from the residence of
the student to the pick-up point at which students transfer to the vehicle
of a parent, custodial parent, or guardian described in subdivision (a) of
this subsection.</para>
<para>(5) When a student who qualifies under the mileage requirements
of subsection (1) of this section lives more than three miles from the location
where the student must be picked up and dropped off in order to access school-provided
free transportation, as measured by the shortest route that must actually
and necessarily be traveled by motor vehicle between his or her residence
and such location, such school-provided transportation shall be deemed partially
provided free transportation. School districts partially providing free transportation
shall pay an allowance to the student's parent or guardian equal to two hundred
eighty-five percent of the mileage rate provided in section 81-1176 multiplied
by each mile actually and necessarily traveled, on each day of attendance,
beyond which the one-way distance from the residence of the student to the
location where the student must be picked up and dropped off exceeds three
miles.</para>
<para>(6) The board may authorize school-provided transportation
to any student who does not qualify under the mileage requirements of subsection
(1) of this section and may charge a fee to the parent or guardian of the
student for such service. An affiliated high school district may provide free
transportation or pay the allowance described in this section for high school
students residing in an affiliated Class I district. No transportation payments
shall be made to a family for mileage not actually traveled by such family.
The number of days the student has attended school shall be reported monthly
by the teacher to the board of such public school district.</para>
<para>(7) No more than one allowance shall be made to a family irrespective
of the number of students in a family being transported to school. If a family
resides in a Class I district which is part of a Class VI district and has
students enrolled in any of the grades offered by the Class I district and
in any of the non-high-school grades offered by the Class VI district, such
family shall receive not more than one allowance for the distance actually
traveled when both districts are on the same direct travel route with one
district being located a greater distance from the residence than the other.
In such cases, the travel allowance shall be prorated among the school districts
involved.</para>
<para>(8) No student shall be exempt from school attendance on account
of distance from the public schoolhouse.</para>
