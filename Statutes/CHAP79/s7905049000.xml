<para>(1) The school board of any Class III school district that
is a member of a learning community may place before the legal voters of the
school district the issue of whether to begin to have a caucus for nominations
by adopting a resolution to place the issue before the legal voters and certifying
the issue to the election commissioner or county clerk prior to September
1 for placement on the ballot at the next statewide general election. The
legal voters of the school district may also have the issue placed on the
ballot at the statewide general election by circulating a petition and gathering
the signatures of the legal voters residing within the school district at
least equal to seven percent of the number of persons registered to vote in
the school district at the last statewide primary election. The petitions
shall be filed with the election commissioner or county clerk for signature
verification on or before August 15 prior to a statewide general election.
If the election commissioner or county clerk determines that the appropriate
number of legal voters signed the petition, he or she shall place the issue
on the ballot for the next statewide general election. The issue shall not
be placed on the ballot again within four years after voting on the issue
at a statewide general election.</para>
<para>(2) Any Class III school district that nominated school board
members by caucus pursuant to this section as it existed immediately before
July 14, 2006, shall continue such procedure until the legal voters of the
district vote not to continue to have a caucus for nominations pursuant to
subsection (3) of this section. A caucus shall be held pursuant to subsection
(5) of this section not less than seventy days prior to the holding of the
election to nominate two or more candidates for each vacancy to be voted upon
at the election to be held in conjunction with the statewide primary election
pursuant to subsection (1) of section 32-543. No candidate nominated shall
have his or her name placed upon the ballot for the general election unless,
not more than ten days after his or her nomination, he or she files with the
secretary of the school board a written statement accepting the nomination.
The secretary of the school board shall certify the names of the candidates
to the election commissioner or county clerk who shall prepare the official
ballot listing the names as certified and without any area designation. All
legal voters residing within the school district shall be permitted to vote
at such election.</para>
<para>(3) The school board may place before the legal voters of
the school district the issue of whether to continue to have a caucus for
nominations by adopting a resolution to place the issue before the legal voters
and certifying the issue to the election commissioner or county clerk prior
to September 1 for placement on the ballot at the next statewide general election.
The legal voters of the school district may also have the issue placed on
the ballot at the statewide general election by circulating a petition and
gathering the signatures of the legal voters residing within the school district
at least equal to seven percent of the number of persons registered to vote
in the school district at the last statewide primary election. The petitions
shall be filed with the election commissioner or county clerk for signature
verification on or before August 15 prior to a statewide general election.
If the election commissioner or county clerk determines that the appropriate
number of legal voters signed the petition, he or she shall place the issue
on the ballot for the next statewide general election. The issue shall not
be placed on the ballot again within four years after voting on the issue
at a statewide general election.</para>
<para>(4) If the legal voters vote not to continue to have a caucus, the school board shall determine the number
of members to be nominated and elected as provided in subsection
(2) of section 32-543. The terms of the members in office at the time of the
vote shall be extended to the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January
after the expiration of their terms. At the first general election following
the vote, a number of members receiving
the greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of four years and a number of members receiving the next greatest
number of votes shall be elected for a term of two years so that approximately one-half of the school board members
are elected every two years.</para>
<para>(5) A school district which uses a caucus for nominations
shall develop rules and procedures for conducting the caucus which will ensure:</para>
<para>(a) Publication of the rules and procedures by multiple sources
if necessary so that every resident of the school district has access to information
on the process for placing a name in nomination and voting at the caucus;</para>
<para>(b) Facilities for voting at the caucus which comply with
the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and which will accommodate
a reasonably anticipated number of legal voters;</para>

election, including the secrecy of the ballot, one vote per legal voter, and
only legal voters of the school district being allowed to vote;</para>
<para>(d) Equal access to all legal voters of the school district,
including the presence of an interpreter at the caucus at the expense of the
school district and ballots for the blind and visually impaired to provide
access to the process by all legal voters of the school district;</para>
<para>(e) Adequate time and opportunity for legal voters of the
school district to exercise their right to vote; and</para>
<para>(f) Notification of nomination to the candidates and to the
secretary of the school board.</para>
<para>The rules and regulations shall be approved by the election
commissioner or county clerk prior to use for a caucus.</para>
