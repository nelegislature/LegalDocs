system; time served in armed forces or on leave of absence; resignation for
maternity purposes; effect.</catchline><para>(1) Any member who
is eligible for reemployment on or after December 12, 1994, pursuant to 38
U.S.C. 4301 et seq., as adopted under
section 55-161, or who is eligible for reemployment under section 55-160 may
pay to the retirement system after the date of his or her return from active
military service, and within the period required by law, not to exceed five
years, an amount equal to the sum of all deductions which would have been
made from the salary which he or she would have received during the period
of military service for which creditable service is desired. If such payment
is made, the member shall be entitled to credit for membership service in
determining his or her annuity for the period for which contributions have
been made and the board shall be responsible for any funding necessary to
provide for the benefit which is attributable to this increase in the member's
creditable service. The member's payments shall be paid as the trustees may
direct, through direct payments to the retirement system or on an installment
basis pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization between
the member and the school district. Creditable service may be purchased only
in one-tenth-year increments, starting with the most recent years' salary.</para>
<para>(2) Under such rules and regulations as the board may prescribe,
any member who was away from his or her position while on a leave of absence
from such position authorized by the board of education of the school district
by which he or she was employed at the time of such leave of absence or pursuant
to any contractual agreement entered into by such school district may receive
credit for any or all time he or she was on leave of absence. Such time shall
be included in creditable service when determining eligibility for death,
disability, termination, and retirement benefits. The member who receives
the credit shall earn benefits during the leave based on salary at the level
received immediately prior to the leave of absence. Such credit shall be received
if such member pays into the retirement system (a) an amount equal to the
sum of the deductions from his or her salary for the portion of the leave
for which creditable service is desired, (b) any contribution which the school
district would have been required to make for the portion of the leave for
which creditable service is desired had he or she continued to receive salary
at the level received immediately prior to the leave of absence, and (c) regular
interest on these combined payments from the date such deductions would have
been made to the date of repayment. Such amounts shall be paid as the trustees
may direct, through direct payments to the retirement system or on an installment
basis pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization between
the member and the school district over a period not to exceed five years
from the date of the termination of his or her leave of absence. Interest
on any delayed payment shall be at the rate of regular interest. Creditable
service may be purchased only in one-tenth-year increments, starting with
the most recent years' salary, and if payments are made on an installment
basis, creditable service will be credited only as payment has been made to
the retirement system to purchase each additional one-tenth-year increment.
Leave of absence shall be construed to include, but not be limited to, sabbaticals,
maternity leave, exchange teaching programs, full-time leave as an elected
official of a professional association or collective-bargaining unit, or leave
of absence to pursue further education or study. A leave of absence granted
pursuant to this section shall not exceed four years in length, and in order
to receive credit for the leave of absence, the member must have returned
to employment with the school district within one year after termination of
the leave of absence.</para>
<para>(3) Until one year after May 2, 2001, any member currently
employed by the school district who resigned from full-time employment with
the school district for maternity purposes prior to September 1, 1979, and
was reemployed as a full-time employee by the school district before the end
of the school year following the school year of such member's resignation
may have such absence treated as though the absence was a leave of absence
described in subsection (2) of this section. The period of such absence for
maternity purposes shall be included in creditable service when determining
the member's eligibility for death, disability, termination, and retirement
benefits if the member submits satisfactory proof to the board that the prior
resignation was for maternity purposes and the member complies with the payment
provisions of subsection (2) of this section before the one-year anniversary
of May 2, 2001.</para>
