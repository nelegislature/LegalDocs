For retirements after June 15, 1989, and before April 18, 1992, the applicable percentage shall be one and sixty-five hundredths percent of his or her final average compensation.

If the compensation for the preceding plan year was reduced as a result of unpaid absence from work, the compensation used in the capping calculation will be the greater of (i) the annualized compensation for the preceding year as if it had been fully received or (ii) the most recent preceding plan year in which the member had no unpaid absence from work. Such member's compensation for the first plan year of the capping period shall be compared to the member's compensation received for the plan year immediately preceding the capping period.
