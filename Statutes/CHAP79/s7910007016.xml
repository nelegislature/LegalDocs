calculation.</catchline><para>For school fiscal year 2008-09 and
each school fiscal year thereafter, the department shall calculate basic funding
for each district as follows:</para>
<para>(1) A comparison group shall be established for each district
consisting of the districts for which basic funding is being calculated, the
five larger districts that are closest in size to the district for which basic
funding is being calculated as measured by formula students, and the five
smaller districts that are closest in size to the district for which basic
funding is being calculated as measured by formula students. If there are
not five districts that are larger than the district for which basic funding
is being calculated or if there are not five districts that are smaller than
the district for which basic funding is being calculated, the comparison group
shall consist of only as many districts as fit the criteria. If more than
one district has exactly the same number of formula students as the largest
or smallest district in the comparison group, all of the districts with exactly
the same number of formula students as the largest or smallest districts in
the comparison group shall be included in the comparison group. If one or
more districts have exactly the same number of formula students as the district
for which basic funding is being calculated, all such districts shall be included
in the comparison group in addition to the five larger districts and the five
smaller districts. The comparison group shall remain the same for the final
calculation of aid pursuant to section 79-1065;</para>
<para>(2) For districts with nine hundred or more formula students,
basic funding shall equal the formula
students multiplied by the average of the adjusted general fund operating
expenditures per formula student for each district in the comparison group,
excluding both the district with the highest adjusted general fund operating
expenditures per formula
student and the district with the lowest adjusted general fund operating expenditures
per formula student of the districts in the comparison group; and</para>
<para>(3) For districts with fewer than nine hundred formula students,
basic funding shall equal the product of the average of the adjusted general
fund operating expenditures for each district in the comparison group, excluding
both the district with the highest adjusted general fund operating expenditures
and the district with the lowest adjusted general fund operating expenditures
of the districts in the comparison group.</para>
