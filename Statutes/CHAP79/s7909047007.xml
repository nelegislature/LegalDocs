year or (b) one percent;</para><para>(2) Each retired member or beneficiary shall receive the sum of
the annual benefit adjustment and such retiree's total monthly benefit less
withholding, which sum shall be the retired member's or beneficiary's adjusted
total monthly benefit. Each retired member or beneficiary shall receive the
adjusted total monthly benefit until the expiration of the annuity option
selected by the member or until the retired member or beneficiary again qualifies
for the annual benefit adjustment, whichever occurs first;</para>

adjustment provided in this section so that the cost-of-living adjustment
provided to the retired member or beneficiary at the time of the annual benefit
adjustment does not exceed the change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban

year to June 30 of the present year. If the consumer price index used in this
section is discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United
