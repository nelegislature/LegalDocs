Except as provided in section 79-845, each such contract shall be deemed renewed and in force and effect until a majority of the governing board votes or the Department of Health and Human Services determines, sixty days before the close of the contract period, to amend or terminate the contract for just cause. The department or the secretary of the governing board shall notify each teacher or school nurse in writing at least ninety days before the close of the contract period of any conditions of unsatisfactory performance or a reduction in teaching staff or nursing staff that the department or board considers may be just cause to either amend or terminate the contract for the ensuing year. Any teacher or school nurse so notified shall have the right to file, within five days after receipt of such notice, a written request with the department or board for a hearing before the department or board. Upon receipt of such request, the department or board shall order the hearing to be held within ten days after such receipt and shall give written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the teacher or school nurse. At the hearing, evidence shall be presented in support of the reasons given for considering amendment or termination of the contract and the teacher or school nurse shall be permitted to produce evidence related thereto. The department or board shall render the decision to amend or terminate a contract based on the evidence produced at the hearing.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1973, LB 422, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 82, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 493, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1977, LB 368, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1978, LB 908, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 442, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1982, LB 259, &#167; 16; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 663, &#167; 42; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 511, &#167; 59; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 245, &#167; 64; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 239, &#167; 3; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1994), &#167; 79-1254.02; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 473; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1044, &#167; 818; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB296, &#167; 712.</para></source><annotation><para>Pursuant to former sections 79-1254.02 to 79-1254.08 and sections 79-12,107 to 79-12,121, the Legislature has attenuated a school board's discretion to pare its staff in the face of reduced needs and has imposed specific procedures for achieving a reduction in force.
