only be used for purposes approved by representatives of two-thirds of the
member school districts in an educational service unit, representing a majority
of the students in the member school districts. The valuation of individual
school districts shall not be the only consideration
in determining the utilization of such funds received after July
1, 2010. Each educational service unit shall prepare and transmit a written
proposal of core services offerings and use of the property tax levy to all
member school districts. The member school districts through their designated
representatives shall indicate their approval or disapproval of the proposal
within thirty calendar days after receipt of the proposal, and failure to
so indicate within such time period shall be deemed approval of the proposal.</para>
