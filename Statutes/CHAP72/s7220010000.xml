The council shall follow the requirements for zoning regulations in sections 23-114 to 23-114.05 and 23-164 to 23-174.10, except that no separate planning commission is required and the council shall fulfill the duties of both the county board and the planning commission in such sections.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2000, LB 1234, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 1003, &#167; 45. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
