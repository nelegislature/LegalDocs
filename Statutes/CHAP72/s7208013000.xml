<para>(1) Each
state agency shall by September 15 of each year submit to the State Building
Administrator a list of all state-owned buildings and land for which it is
responsible and shall note the current and planned uses of each building and
parcel of land. The State Building Administrator shall compile the information
on state-owned buildings and land and provide it, along with any other information
or recommendations he or she may consider relevant to the purposes of sections
72-811 to 72-818, to the Vacant Building and Excess Land Committee and
to the Legislative Fiscal Analyst. The
information provided to the Legislative Fiscal Analyst shall be submitted
electronically.</para>
<para>(2) The committee
shall meet to review the information and consider further action or possible
amendments to orders made pursuant to this section. If the committee determines
that there is reason to believe that any particular state-owned building or
piece of land is vacant or excess, the committee shall review the status of
the building or land and by majority vote determine whether it should be declared
vacant or excess.</para>
<para>(3) If the
committee declares a building or land to be vacant or excess, it shall order
either maintenance of the building or land by the state building division
of the Department of Administrative Services or the disposal of the building
or land through sale, lease, demolition, or otherwise. Any order for disposal
of a building may include related lands. In determining the appropriate action
to be taken in regard to a building or land, the committee shall consider
the benefits to the state of the alternative possible actions, including cost-effectiveness,
other possible future uses of the building or land for state purposes, and
the necessity or utility of the building or land for the furtherance of existing
or planned state programs.</para>
