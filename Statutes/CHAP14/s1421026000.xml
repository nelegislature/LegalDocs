maintain regular fire hydrants on service mains in the streets of the
municipalities not now equipped therewith and also upon service mains that
may hereafter be installed in such municipalities. The board of directors may adopt such rules for the placement

water mains and reset hydrants at their original locations whenever necessary.</para>
