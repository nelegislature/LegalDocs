No member or officer of the fire department shall be discharged for political reasons, nor shall a person be employed or taken into such department for political reasons. Before a fireman can be discharged, charges must be filed against him before the council and a hearing had thereon, and an opportunity given such member to defend against such charges, but this provision shall not be construed to prevent peremptory suspension of such member by his superiors in case of misconduct or neglect of duty or disobedience to orders. Whenever any such suspension is made, charges shall be at once filed before the council by the person ordering such suspension, and a trial had thereon. The council shall have the power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers, and to administer oaths to them in the same manner and with like effect and under the same penalties as in the case of magistrates exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction under the statutes of the State of Nebraska. It shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be authorized or defined by ordinance.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
