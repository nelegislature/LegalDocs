The total cost of improvements shall be levied at one time upon the property and become delinquent as provided in this section. The city may require that the total amount of such assessment be paid in less than ten years if, in each year of the payment schedule, the maximum amount payable, excluding interest, is five hundred dollars. If the total amount is more than five thousand dollars, then the city shall establish a payment schedule of at least ten years but not longer than twenty years with the total amount payable in equal yearly installments, except that the minimum amount payable shall not be less than five hundred dollars per year, excluding interest. The first installment shall be due and delinquent fifty days from the date of levy, the second, one year from date of levy, and a like installment shall be due and delinquent annually thereafter until all such installments are paid. Each of the installments except the first shall draw interest at a rate not to exceed the rate of interest specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature, from the time of levy until the installment becomes delinquent and, after the installment becomes delinquent, shall draw interest at the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature, payable in advance, as in other cases of special assessments. Such special assessments shall also be collected and enforced as in other cases of special assessments.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
