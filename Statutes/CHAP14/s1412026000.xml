The rates may also be so fixed and adjusted as to provide a reserve fund reasonably sufficient to provide for the cost of the continued operation, supervision, maintenance, and repair of said bridge or bridges for a period not to exceed twenty-five years after the removal of toll charges. After the provision of said funds has been completed, such bridge or bridges shall thereafter be maintained and operated free of toll unless or until the charging of reasonable tolls is continued or resumed by the governing body of the city or its commission in order to finance reconstruction, extension, enlargement, replacement or renewal of that particular bridge or in aid of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, extension, enlargement, replacement or renewal of any other bridge owned in whole or in part by said city. The owners of outstanding bonds issued to finance the bridge, or the authorized trustee therefor, shall have the right to compel the fixing of adequate tolls by application to any court of competent jurisdiction. In case the city is at the same time providing for the payment of more than one bridge through the collection of tolls, the tolls upon such bridges may be maintained and adjusted so that each bridge shall assist the financing of the other.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1929, c. 176, &#167; 12, p. 622; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 14-1212; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 14-1226.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
