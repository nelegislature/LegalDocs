The space below the surface of property, owned by the county for courthouse sites or other public uses, the space below the surface of the streets, and the space above and below the surface of an area adjacent to public buildings within the civic center of such city could properly and beneficially be used for parking areas and such use would promote public safety, convenience, and welfare; and</para><para>(4) Providing for the relieving of traffic congestion is a matter of public welfare, of general public interest, of statewide concern, and within the powers reserved to the state.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 57, &#167; 1, p. 359; </para><para>Laws 2022, LB800, &#167; 309. </para><operativedate>July 21, 2022</operativedate></source></law>
