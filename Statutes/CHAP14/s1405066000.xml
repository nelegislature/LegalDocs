In addition to considering the rate bid for printing, the purchasing agent may give weight to the character of circulation, quality of printing, plant, delivery service, and responsibility of the bidders in determining the lowest and best bid.

The purchasing agent shall notify the city clerk of his selection of the official newspaper, which shall continue as such throughout the term of the council. The council may order additional publication of any of its proceedings in any other qualified newspaper or publication.

In case of refusal or neglect of the official newspaper to publish any required notice, the city clerk shall post it in a conspicuous place in the city hall, and he shall keep a written record of such posting witnessed by two persons. The record of such posting shall be evidence that the same was done as required and shall be sufficient to fulfill the requirement of publication. The city shall not be without an official newspaper more than thirty days at a time.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
