No plat of such real estate shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds or have any force or effect unless the same shall have been first approved by the city council of such city. Such city shall have authority within such area to regulate the subdivision of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership or building development; to prescribe standards for laying out subdivisions in harmony with a comprehensive plan; to require the installation of improvements by the owner or by the creation of public improvement districts; by requiring a good and sufficient bond guaranteeing installation of such improvement, or by requiring the execution of a contract with the city insuring the installation of such improvements; and to require the dedication of land for adequate streets, drainage ways, and easements for sewers and utilities. All such requirements for improvements shall operate uniformly throughout the area of jurisdiction of such city. For purposes of this section, subdivision shall mean the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or more lots, blocks, or other divisions of lands for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of ownership or building developments except that the division of land shall not be considered to be subdivision when the smallest parcel created is more than ten acres in size. The city council of any such city may withhold approval of a plat until the appropriate department of the city has certified that the improvements required by ordinance have been satisfactorily installed or until a sufficient bond guaranteeing installation of the improvements has been posted with the city or until public improvement districts have been created or until a contract has been executed insuring the installation of such improvements.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
