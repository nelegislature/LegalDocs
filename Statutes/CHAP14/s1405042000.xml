Whenever any water main is laid by a metropolitan utilities district in a street of a city of the metropolitan class and there are lots or grounds abutting upon such street or embraced within any improvement district which are owned and controlled by the city, one-half the cost of constructing such water main in front of such lot or grounds, if special benefits equal such an amount, to be determined by the metropolitan utilities district, but not to exceed fifty cents per lineal front foot, shall be paid out of the general fund of the city. The city council shall provide for the payment of such costs to the metropolitan utilities district.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
