Such bonds shall be short-term bonds not to exceed three years, redeemable at par on any semiannual interest date upon ten days' notice by publication once in the official newspaper, and may be sold at a discount of not more than two percent. The proceeds of the sale of such bonds may be advanced by the governing body of the city to a bridge commission created as provided in sections 14-1227 and 14-1244 to 14-1246, to be expended by such commission in preliminary work or for costs of operation and maintenance or interest charges as may be necessary. Whether expended by the governing body of the city or by a bridge commission, the amount so expended shall constitute a prior and first lien upon revenue derived from the operation of the bridge in connection with which such expenditures have been had, and shall be repaid as soon as possible and used by the governing body of the city to purchase or redeem said short-term bonds. The amount of such bonds shall be included as a part of the cost of the bridge and shall be repaid out of the proceeds of any bonds issued for permanent financing.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1929, c. 176, &#167; 8, p. 617; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 14-1208; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 14-1215; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 51, &#167; 21, p. 286.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
