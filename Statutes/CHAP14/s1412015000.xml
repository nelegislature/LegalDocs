Such bonds shall be short-term bonds not to exceed three years, redeemable at par on any semiannual interest date upon ten days' notice by publication once in the official newspaper, and may be sold at a discount of not more than two percent. The proceeds of the sale of such bonds may be advanced by the governing body of the city to a bridge commission created as provided in sections 14-1227 and 14-1244 to 14-1246, to be expended by such commission in preliminary work or for costs of operation and maintenance or interest charges as may be necessary.

The amount of such bonds shall be included as a part of the cost of the bridge and shall be repaid out of the proceeds of any bonds issued for permanent financing.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1929, c. 176, &#167; 8, p. 617; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 14-1208; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 14-1215; </para><para>Laws 1969, c. 51, &#167; 21, p. 286.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
