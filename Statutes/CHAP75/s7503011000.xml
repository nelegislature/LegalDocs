Public convenience and necessity</emphasis></para><para>A litigant may not request a certificate of public convenience and necessity and in the same action and at the same time challenge the constitutionality of sections 75-301 through 75-322. In determining public convenience and necessity, the deciding factors are (1) whether the operation will serve a useful purpose responsive to a public demand or need, (2) whether this purpose can or will be served as well by existing carriers, and (3) whether it can be served by the applicant in a specified manner without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest. An applicant who has been operating under color of authority need not make the same showing that an applicant who has never operated must make, and there is a presumption that the proposed service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. When an applicant has been illegally conducting business for a sufficient period of time under a mistaken belief that its operations were legal, the color of right principles of law apply. However, if the applicant knew that its operations were illegal, then the color of right principles do not apply.

In re Application of A Touch of Class Limousine, 243 Neb. 33, 497 N.W.2d 71 (1993).</para><para>The existence of an adequate and satisfactory service by motor carriers already in the area is complete negation of public need and demand for added service by another carrier. In re Application of Kilthau, 236 Neb. 811, 464 N.W.2d 162 (1991).</para><para>To comply with this section, the applicant must prove, in part, that the applicant is fit financially. In re Application of Overland Armored Exp., 229 Neb. 524, 428 N.W.2d 166 (1988).</para><para>Public demand or need, which an applicant must prove to obtain a certificate from the Public Service Commission, is a present actual need or a need which will likely occur within the reasonably immediate or foreseeable future. In re Application of Renzenberger, Inc., 225 Neb. 30, 402 N.W.2d 294 (1987).</para><para>Public Service Commission's order granting certificate of public convenience and necessity was arbitrary and capricious; applicant had not met its burden of proof. In re Application of Red Carpet Limo. Serv., Inc., 221 Neb. 340, 377 N.W.2d 91 (1985).</para><para>In determining the issue of public convenience and necessity, controlling questions are whether the operation will serve a useful purpose responsive to a public demand or need; whether this purpose can or will be served as well by existing carriers; and whether it can be served by applicant in a specified manner without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers, contrary to public interest. In re Application of Nebraska Transport Co., Inc., 210 Neb. 269, 313 N.W.2d 686 (1981).</para><para>Under this section, a certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the operations covered by the application, if it is found after notice and hearing that the applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed, and to conform to the rules and regulations of the Nebraska Public Service Commission and that the proposed service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.

Dilts Trucking, Inc. v. Peake, Inc., 197 Neb. 459, 249 N.W.2d 732 (1977).</para><para>There must be finding that applicant is fit, willing, and able to perform the proposed service, and that the service offered is or will be required by public convenience and necessity in granting a certificate therefor. Robinson v. National Trailer Convoy, Inc., 188 Neb. 474, 197 N.W.2d 633 (1972).</para><para>Finding that proposed operation of a contract carrier will be consistent with public interest is necessary for issuance of permit.

Nebraska State Railway Commission v. Seward Motor Freight, Inc., 188 Neb. 223, 196 N.W.2d 200 (1972).</para><para><emphasis>3. Burden of proof</emphasis></para><para>Statement by Public Service Commission that it is inconsistent with the public interest to grant a contract carrier permit when existing common carriers can adequately serve the shipper improperly exhibited a preference for common carriers over contract carriage. Upon proof by an applicant for contract carrier authority that the proposed service is specialized and tailored to the customer's distinct needs, the burden shifts to protesting common carriers to show they can provide the same specialized service; thus the Public Service Commission erred in requiring an applicant for a contract carrier permit to establish the inability of existing common carriers to provide the same specialized service it proposed to provide. In re Application of Northland Transp., 239 Neb. 918, 479 N.W.2d 764 (1992).</para><para>The applicant has the burden to establish that its proposed service is specialized and fits the needs of the proposed contracting shipper or shippers; that it is fit, willing, and able to perform the service; and that the proposed operation will be consistent with the public interest. If the service proposed by the applicant can be performed as well by common carriers, the application should be denied because a need for a contract carrier has not been established. The Public Service Commission must weigh the special requirements of the shipper against the adequacy of the existing common carrier service.

Ruan Transp. Corp. v.
