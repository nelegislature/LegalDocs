If the applicant is an individual, the application shall include the applicant's social security number.

Such fees shall be paid to the State Treasurer and credited to the General Fund;</para><para>(2) File security which may be a bond issued by a corporate surety company and payable to the commission, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a certificate of deposit, subject to the approval of the commission, for the benefit of any producer who files a valid claim arising from a sale to a grain dealer. The security shall be in an amount set by the commission of not less than thirty-five thousand dollars and not more than one million dollars. Amounts used in the calculation of the security shall include all direct delivery grain purchases and exchanges valued on the date delivery is made. Amounts used in the calculation of the security shall not include any transactions in which direct delivery grain is exchanged for a post-direct delivery storage position and the post-direct delivery storage position is created by an in-store transfer on the same date as the delivery of the direct delivery grain. Such security shall be furnished on the condition that the licensee will pay for any grain purchased upon demand, not later than fifteen days after the date of the last shipment of any contract. The liability of the surety shall cover purchases made by the grain dealer during the time the bond is in force. A grain dealer's bond filed with the commission shall be in continuous force and effect until canceled by the surety. The liability of the surety on any bond required by this section shall not accumulate for each successive license period during which the bond is in force; and</para><para>(3) File a reviewed or audited fiscal year-end financial statement prepared by an independent certified public accounting firm. If licensing as an individual, the financial statement shall be prepared in accordance with Other Comprehensive Basis of Accountancy, as filed with the board, for a personal financial statement, using historical cost and accrual basis of accounting.
