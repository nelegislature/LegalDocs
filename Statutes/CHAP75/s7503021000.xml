In the event that application is made by the legal representative not less than thirty days prior to the end of such period of one year, the commission may, at its discretion and for cause shown, allow the transfer of the authority to the executors, administrators, guardians, trustees, or other legal representatives of the deceased holder for a period to be fixed by the commission. In considering such application, pertinent orders or decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the decedent or mentally incompetent person may be deemed cause for the granting thereof. When the individual holder of a certificate or permit dies or is declared legally incompetent and an application is made to transfer the authority issued under the certificate or permit to his or her legal representative, the commission may dispose of the application without hearing, if notice is given to all interested parties.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1963, c. 425, art.
