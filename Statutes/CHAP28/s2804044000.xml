Casbah, Inc. v. Thone, 651 F.2d 551 (8th Cir. 1981).</para><para>The prohibition of advertising that promotes, in whole or in part, sale of objects designed or intended for use as drug paraphernalia regulates commercial speech in its narrowest sense, i.e., speech which proposes a commercial transaction and which is entitled to lesser protection than other constitutionally guaranteed expression where statute facially does not reach speech which merely glorifies drug culture without direct invitation to purchase specific items. Advertising promoting sale of drug paraphernalia encourages activities which are otherwise crimes under Nebraska law and is thus analogous to advertisements promoting sale of narcotics or soliciting prostitution and can constitutionally be prohibited. Although this statute prohibits advertisements that "only in part" have purpose of promoting sale of drug paraphernalia, court of appeals is obliged to presume legislative intent to act within constitutional bounds, and thus, under statute, where drug paraphernalia is advertised along with innocent items, statute forbids only that part of the advertisement relating to drug paraphernalia and remainder of advertisement is not condemned.
