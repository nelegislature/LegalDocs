Legislature recognizes the need for the investigation and provision of services
to certain persons who are substantially impaired and are unable to protect
themselves from abuse, neglect,
or exploitation. Often such persons cannot find others able or
willing to render assistance. The Legislature intends through the Adult Protective
Services Act to establish a program designed to fill this need and to assure
the availability of the program to all eligible persons. It is also the intent
of the Legislature to authorize the least restriction possible on the exercise
of personal and civil rights consistent with the person's need for services.</para>
