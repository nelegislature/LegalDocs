State v. Hruza, 223 Neb. 837, 394 N.W.2d 643 (1986).</para><para>In order for the State to convict under this statute, the State must prove that the check was issued with the intent to defraud, and such intent must occur at the time the check is drawn. The maker of a postdated check will not be guilty of violating this statute when he or she has informed the payee at the time of its delivery that funds in the bank are not adequate to pay the check if presented immediately after issuance.

State v. Wiley, 219 Neb. 740, 365 N.W.2d 844 (1985).</para><para>In prosecution under this section, trial court's instruction defining "thing of value" as definition appears in section 28-109(22) was correct. Trial court correctly refused defendant's request for instruction defining value as definition appears in U.C.C. section 3-303 in prosecution under this section. State v. Spaulding, 211 Neb. 575, 319 N.W.2d 449 (1982).</para><para>The prosecutor may relate the underlying facts upon which the court can find the defendant guilty when a plea of "no contest" has been entered. State v. Johnson, 209 Neb. 308, 307 N.W.2d 525 (1981).</para><para>By its terms, this section requires proof that one intended to defraud by obtaining property, services, or present value of any kind in exchange for a check or other order, knowing at the time of issuing such check or order that he has no account with the drawee, or, if he has such an account, knowing that he does not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the drawee for the payment of such check or order in full upon its presentation. State v. Kock, 207 Neb. 731, 300 N.W.2d 824 (1981).</para><para>In order to warrant the imposition of the enhanced penalties for issuing a bad check under section 28-611(2), R.R.S.1943, prior convictions must have occurred under subdivision (1)(c) or (1)(d) of that statute. Prior convictions under previous "bad check" statutes may not be used to enhance the penalties under the "bad check" statute currently in effect. State v.
