The test is whether evidence of possession of a revolver or gun of prohibited description, which is in apparently good condition and has the characteristics and appearance commonly understood to be those of the firearm it purports to be, is prima facie evidence sufficient to go to the trier of fact in a prosecution for being a person under the age of 18 in possession of a pistol, revolver, or any other form of short-barreled hand firearm.
