Instead, it unambiguously criminalizes the persuasion itself. Because this section is focused on persuading a child to engage in an illegal sexual act, the relevant time for determining whether the encouraged sexual act was illegal will generally be when the defendant was engaged in the persuasion. Depending upon the substance of the persuasion, however, this may not always be true. But where the facts did not warrant requiring further proof of the defendant's intent to commit an illegal sexual act, the State was not required to prove that he took a substantial step toward committing such act. State v. Knutson, 288 Neb. 823, 852 N.W.2d 307 (2014).</para><para>This section does not implicate speech regarding otherwise legal activity; it targets only speech used for the purpose of enticing a child to engage in illegal sexual conduct, and such speech is not protected by the First Amendment.
