At the hearing the burden of proving the accuracy and consistency of the record shall be on the department. The hearing shall be conducted by the chief executive officer of the department or his or her designated representative, who is hereby authorized and empowered to order the amendment, expunction, or removal of the record to make such record accurate or consistent with the requirements of the Adult Protective Services Act. The decision shall be made in writing within thirty days of the close of the hearing and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.
