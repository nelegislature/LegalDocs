Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), where the defendant was not sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and instead had the opportunity for parole in just under 14 years, a full mitigation hearing was held before his sentencing at which both the State and the defendant were given an opportunity to present evidence, and the court stated that it had to consider the fact that a jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree but also had to consider the mitigating factors under this section, as well as a psychological evaluation.
