<para>The Legislature finds that as a result of the enactment of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as the act
existed on January 1, 2014, and the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Nebraska's
laws providing for regulation of real property appraisers require restructuring
in order to comply with such acts. Compliance with the acts is necessary to
ensure an adequate number of appraisers in Nebraska to conduct appraisals
of real estate involved in federally related transactions as defined in such
acts.</para>
