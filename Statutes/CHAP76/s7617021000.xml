The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio that the time-share interval owner's liability bears to the liabilities of all time-share interval owners whose interests are subject to the lien. Upon receipt of payment, the lienholder shall promptly deliver to the time-share interval owner a release of the lien covering that time-share interval. After payment, the managing entity shall not assess or have a lien against that time-share interval for any portion of the expenses incurred in connection with that lien.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1980, LB 945, &#167; 21. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
