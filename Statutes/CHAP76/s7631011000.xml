property.</para>

failure to disclose the private transfer fee obligation, including the amount
of any private transfer fee paid by the buyer, or the difference between (i)

subject to a private transfer fee obligation, and (b) all attorney's fees,
expenses, and costs incurred by the buyer in seeking the buyer's remedies
