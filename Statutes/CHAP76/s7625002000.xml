The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 100 degrees 00 minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel 39 degrees 50 minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates. N = 0 meters and E = 500,000 meters.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1998, LB 924, &#167; 64; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1999), &#167; 86-1602; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 1105, &#167; 498. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
