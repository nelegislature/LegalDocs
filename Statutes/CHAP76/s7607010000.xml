Damage to fencing and crops occurring after the original construction and resulting from the operation or maintenance of the improvement shall not be included in such assessment but shall be determined by agreement of the parties and paid to the owner or lessee by the condemner or its successors and assigns at the time such fencing or crops are damaged. Upon failure of the parties to agree, such damages may be determined in the same manner as provided under sections 76-701 to 76-724.
