The purchaser at any such sale shall acquire the same title to the lands purchased which he would have acquired if the nonresident alien had been a resident or citizen. In case there is only one party in interest, he may maintain an ex parte proceeding and have the land sold in the same manner, and the purchaser shall receive the same title as if there were several parties in interest, and after the payment of costs the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the sole party in interest.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1911, c. 100, &#167; 1, p. 365; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 6274; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 5688; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 76-503; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 76-409.</para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Petition for partition,</emphasis> procedure, see section 25-2170 et seq.</para></crossreference><annotation><para>Escheat must be established and payment made as provided in section 76-408, and under certain circumstances, section 76-409.
