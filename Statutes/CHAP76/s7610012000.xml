A cancellation of recorded notice of default under a trust deed shall, when acknowledged, be entitled to be recorded and shall be sufficient if made and executed by the trustee in substantially the following form:</para><para>Cancellation of Notice of Default</para><para>The undersigned hereby cancels the notice of default filed for record ......., 20...., and recorded in book ........., page ......, (or computer system reference ..........)

While this section contemplates and references the filing of a notice of default, it does not itself require the notice of default or specify the necessary contents of a notice of default, which requirements are set forth in section 76-1006. This section adds no additional requirements for notices of default to those in section 76-1006. First Nat. Bank North Platte v. Cardenas, 299 Neb. 497, 909 N.W.2d 79 (2018).</para><para>This section provides that in order to cure a default, the trustor must pay to the beneficiary the entire amount then due. Thus, a default must be cured by tendering payment. A tender of payment is more than being willing and able to pay. It is an offer to perform, coupled with the present ability of immediate performance, which, were it not for the refusal of cooperation by the party to whom tender is made, would immediately satisfy the condition or obligation for which the tender is made.
