<para>The declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage
of the mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust encumbering the units
approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition
to the effectiveness of those actions, but no requirement for approval may
operate to (i) deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs
of the association by the unit owners or the executive board, or (ii) prevent
the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in, or
settling any litigation or proceeding, or receiving and distributing any insurance
proceeds except pursuant to section 76-871. The
declaration may not provide that a lien on a member's unit for any assessment
levied against the unit relates back to the date of filing of the declaration
or that such lien takes priority over any mortgage or deed of trust on the
unit recorded subsequent to the filing of the declaration and prior to the
recording by the association of the notice required under subsection (a) of
section 76-874.</para>
