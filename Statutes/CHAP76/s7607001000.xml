<para>Where the condemnor has a pre-existing lien interest in the land being acquired by condemnation, it is appropriate for the district court to consider the question of a setoff from the award, in the amount of the lien, upon timely motion by the condemnor. City of Waverly v. Hedrick, 283 Neb. 464, 810 N.W.2d 706 (2012).</para><para>When a political subdivision with the power of eminent domain damages property for a public use, the property owner may seek damages in an action for tort, in an action for inverse condemnation under the provisions of sections 76-701 to 76-725, or in an action under the language of Neb. Const. Art. I, sec. 21. Slusarski v. County of Platte, 226 Neb. 889, 416 N.W.2d 213 (1987).</para><para>Although this action was not originally commenced under sections 76-701 to 76-725, all the parties and the court understood it to be an action for inverse condemnation.
