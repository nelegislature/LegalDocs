A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants by the Nebraska Condominium Act, nor may units constitute a class because they are owned by a declarant.</para><para>(d) Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements and common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must equal one if stated as fractions or one hundred percent if stated as percentages. In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the result derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.</para><para>(e) The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is allocated, is void.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1983, LB 433, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 2020, LB808, &#167; 42. </para></source></law>
