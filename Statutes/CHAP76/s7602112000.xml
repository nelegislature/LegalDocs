Approval of a proposed acquisition may be denied upon a finding by the appropriate governing body that the acquisition is not in the public interest when the easement is inconsistent with (a) a comprehensive plan for the area which had been officially adopted and was in force at the time of the conveyance, (b) any national, state, regional, or local program furthering conservation or preservation, or (c) any known proposal by a governmental body for use of the land.</para><para>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the state, or any state agency or political subdivision other than a city, village, or county, may accept an easement after first referring the proposed acquisition to and receiving comments from the local planning commission with jurisdiction over the property, which shall within sixty days of the referral provide such comments regarding the conformity of the proposed acquisition to comprehensive planning for the area. If such comments are not received within sixty days, the proposed acquisition shall be deemed approved by the local planning commission.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1981, LB 173, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 1234, &#167; 12. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
