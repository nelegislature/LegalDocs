One of the distances, to be known as the "northing" or "N", shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. The other, to be known as the "easting" or "E", shall give the position in an east-and-west direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented horizontal control stations of the North American National Geodetic Horizontal Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed based on the system described in the Nebraska Plane Coordinate System Act. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to the Nebraska Plane Coordinate System.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1998, LB 924, &#167; 65; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1999), &#167; 86-1603; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 1105, &#167; 499. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
