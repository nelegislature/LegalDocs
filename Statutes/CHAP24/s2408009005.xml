In designating a primary office, the Supreme Court shall locate judges so as to provide maximum service to all areas of the judicial district. If more than one county is acceptable as a primary office, the Supreme Court may so state and may leave the final choice of the location of the primary office to the judge. The Supreme Court may, after consultation with a representative sampling of the lawyers of the judicial district, relocate a district or county court judge within his or her judicial district.
