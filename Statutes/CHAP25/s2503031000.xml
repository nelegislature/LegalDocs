The third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the service if the third-party plaintiff files the third-party complaint not later than ten days after filing the original answer. Otherwise the third-party plaintiff must obtain leave of the trial court on motion upon notice to all parties to the action. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall have all the rights of a defendant including the rights authorized by this section. The third-party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim. The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-party defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant shall have all the rights of a defendant including the rights authorized by this section. The court on its own motion, or motion of any party, may move to strike the third-party claim, or for its severance or separate trial if the third-party claim should delay trial, might tend to confuse a jury, or in any way jeopardize the rights of the plaintiff. A third-party defendant or subsequent defendants may proceed under this section.</para><para>(2) When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may cause a third party to be brought in under circumstances which under this section would entitle a defendant to do so.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1967, c. 144, &#167; 1, p. 441; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 876, &#167; 11. </para></source><annotation><para>A motion to sever a third-party claim is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and an order granting or denying such motion is reviewed by an appellate court for an abuse of discretion. Hradecky v. State, 264 Neb. 771, 652 N.W.2d 277 (2002).</para><para>This section requires leave of the trial court before filing a third-party complaint, and whether to grant such leave is entrusted to the discretion of the trial court. A third-party claim under this section may be asserted when a third party's liability is in some way dependent upon the outcome of the main claim or when the third party is secondarily liable to the defendant. Denial of leave to join a third-party defendant is not a final, appealable order because it does not determine the action and prevent a judgment. The term "defendant" in section 25-21,185.10 includes a third-party defendant brought into an action pursuant to this section. Slaymaker v.
