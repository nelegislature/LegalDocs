General</emphasis></para><para>This section contemplates a process by which the finder of fact determines the total noneconomic damages suffered by the plaintiff as the result of injuries proximately caused by the negligence of multiple defendants; then, it allocates a portion of the total to each defendant "in direct proportion to that defendant's percentage of negligence."

Timing</emphasis></para><para>Under the plain language of this section, there must be multiple defendants in a case before the allocation provisions of this section will operate.
