Before the judgment or order is opened, the applicant shall give notice to the adverse party of the intention to make such application and shall file a full answer to the petition or complaint, pay all costs, if the court requires them to be paid, and make it appear to the satisfaction of the court, by affidavit, that during the pendency of the action the applicant had no actual notice thereof in time to appear in court and make a defense. The title to any property, the subject of the judgment or order sought to be opened, which by it, or in consequence of it, has passed to a purchaser in good faith, shall not be affected by any proceedings under this section, nor shall the proceedings affect the title of any property sold before judgment under an attachment. The adverse party, on the hearing of an application to open a judgment or order, as provided by this section, shall be allowed to present counter-affidavits, to show that during the pendency of the action the applicant had notice thereof in time to appear in court and make a defense.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>R.S.1867, Code &#167; 82, p. 406; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 7646; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 8590; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 20-525; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 25-525; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 921, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2002, LB 876, &#167; 17.</para></source><annotation><para><emphasis>1.
