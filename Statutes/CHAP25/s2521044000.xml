sales of mortgaged premises under a decree shall be made by a sheriff or some

part of them are situated.
In all
cases where the sheriff makes such
sale, he or she shall act in his or her official capacity, shall be liable on his or her official bond for all
his or her acts
therein, and shall
receive the same compensation as is provided by law for like services upon
sales under execution.</para>
<para>(2) The sheriff
or other person conducting the sale may, for any cause he or she deems expedient,
postpone the sale of all or any portion of the real property from time to
time until it is completed, and in every such case, notice of postponement
shall be given by public declaration thereof by the sheriff or such other
person at the time and place last appointed for the sale. The public declaration
of the notice of postponement shall include the new date, time, and place
of sale. No other notice of the postponed sale need be given unless the sale
is postponed for longer than forty-five days beyond the day designated in
the notice of sale, in which event notice thereof shall be given in the same
