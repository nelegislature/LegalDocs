If the attachment is not for immediately bringing the witness before the court or officer, a sum may be fixed in which the witness may give an undertaking with surety for his or her appearance. Such sum shall be endorsed on the back of the attachment, and if no sum is so fixed and endorsed, it shall be one hundred dollars. If the witness is not personally served, the court may, by a rule, order him or her to show cause why attachment should not issue against him or her.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>R.S.1867, Code &#167; 357, p. 453; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 7922; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 8864; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 20-1230; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 25-1230; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 1030, &#167; 18. </para></source><annotation><para>Court upon own motion, or on oral request of prosecutor, may issue attachment.
