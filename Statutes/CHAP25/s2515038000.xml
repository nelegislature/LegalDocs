In all cases where two or more executions, which are entitled to no preference over each other, are put into the hands of the same officer, it shall be the duty of the officer, when required, to levy the same on separate parcels of real property of the judgment debtor or debtors, when the same may be divided without material injury; and if the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient to satisfy all the executions chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall be levied on to satisfy each execution as will bear the same proportion in value to the whole as the amount due on the execution bears to the amount of all the executions chargeable thereon.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>R.S.1867, Code &#167; 505, p. 479; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 8084; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 9020; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 20-1538; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 25-1538.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
