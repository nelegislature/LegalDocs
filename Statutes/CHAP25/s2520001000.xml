A district court has no authority to set aside a judgment after the term when any mistake, inadvertence, or neglect was the party's own. The purpose of subsection (3) of this section is to address mishaps beyond a party's control. A litigant seeking vacation or modification of a judgment after term may take one of two routes: The litigant may proceed either under this section or under the district court's independent equity jurisdiction. With regard to subsection (3) of this section, the operative definition of "irregularity" limits the term to the doing or not doing that, in the conduct of a suit at law, which, conformably with the practice of the court, ought or ought not to be done. A judgment marred by irregularity is one rendered contrary to the course of law and practice of the court. Roemer v.

Therefore, relief for errors of law or judicial acts may not be sought under subsection (3). State ex rel. Ward v.
