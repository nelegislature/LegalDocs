A general verdict is that by which they pronounce, generally, upon all or any of the issues either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by which the jury finds the facts only. It must present the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them; and they must be so presented that nothing remains to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>R.S.1867, Code &#167; 292, p. 443; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 7861; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 8805; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 20-1122; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 25-1122.</para></source><annotation><para>Where the jury returned a general verdict in favor of an injured railroad employee on his claims for lost earnings and benefits, it was presumed on appeal that the jury found in favor of the employee on all issues, including lost wages.
