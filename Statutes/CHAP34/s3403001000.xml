and boundaries; court action to settle; procedure.</catchline><para>When
one or more owners of land, the corners and boundaries of which are lost,
destroyed, or in
dispute, desire to have the same established, they may bring an action in
the district court of the county where such lost, destroyed, or disputed corners or boundaries, or part
thereof, are situated, against the owners of the other tracts which will be
affected by the determination or establishment thereof, to have such corners
or boundaries ascertained and permanently established. If any public road
is likely to be affected thereby, the proper county shall be made defendant.
Notice of such action shall be given as in other cases, and if the defendants
or any of them are nonresidents of the state, or unknown, they may be served
by publication as is provided by law. The action shall be a special one, and
the only necessary pleading therein shall be the complaint of the plaintiff describing the
land involved, and, so far as may be, the interest of the respective parties
and asking that certain corners and boundaries therein described, as accurately
as may be, shall be established. Either the plaintiff or defendant may, by
proper plea, put in issue the fact that certain alleged boundaries or corners
are the true ones, or that such have been recognized and acquiesced in by
the parties or their grantors for a period of ten consecutive years, which
issue shall be tried before the district court under its equity jurisdiction
without the intervention of a jury, and appeals from such proceedings shall
be had and taken in conformity with the equity rules.</para>
