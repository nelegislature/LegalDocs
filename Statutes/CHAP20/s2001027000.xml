By the inclusion of the phrase "and other places to which the general public is invited" in subsection (2) of this section, the Legislature evidenced its intent that this statute should apply whenever the general public is invited to a given place at a given time. Softball fields are "places to which the general public is invited" under subsection (2). This section is not limited by considerations of safety. Loewenstein v.
