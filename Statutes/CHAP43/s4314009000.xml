Such a signed and notarized acknowledgment or a certified copy or certified reproduction thereof shall be admissible in evidence in any proceeding to establish support.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1941, c. 81, &#167; 9, p. 324; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 43-709; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 13-109; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1983), &#167; 13-109; </para><para>Laws 1994, LB 1224, &#167; 58; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 752, &#167; 101; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 594, &#167; 21. </para></source>
