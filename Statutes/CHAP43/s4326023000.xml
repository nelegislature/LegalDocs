Workers are unable to enter or remain in the work force due to a shortage of child care resources. The high costs of starting or expanding a child care business creates a barrier to the creation of additional space, especially for infants and children with special needs. It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate two hundred fifty thousand dollars annually to the Child Care Grant Fund from funds designated by the State of Nebraska under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1991, LB 836, &#167; 22. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
