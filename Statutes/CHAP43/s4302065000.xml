In that circumstance, the State must comply with the notification procedures that are statutorily required for other noncustodial parents&#8212;before the dispositional phase. Section 43-263 and this section cannot be constitutionally applied to avoid this notification. But if the State shows that an unmarried, biological father’s whereabouts are unknown and that he has not supported his child, then he is not a parent entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard in a juvenile proceeding involving his child born out of wedlock.
