twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week; (i) automated application
of policy and procedures, to make application of policy less complex and easier
to follow; (j) automated prompts and alerts when actions are due, to enable
case managers and supervisors to manage child welfare cases more efficiently;

child welfare information systems at 45 C.F.R. 1355.50 through 1355.57, implementing
