The capacity of the web-based, statewide automated child welfare information
system shall include: (a) Integration across related social services programs
through automated interfaces, including, but not limited to, the courts, medicaid
eligibility, financial processes, and child support; (b) ease in implementing
future system modifications as user requirements or policies change; (c) compatibility
with multiple vendor platforms; (d) system architecture that provides multiple
options to build additional capacity to manage increased user transactions

at every tier in case of hardware, software, power, or other system component
failure; (f) vendor portals to support direct entry of child welfare case
information, as appropriate, by private providers' staff serving children,

details and outcome measures to cellular telephones or other mobile communication
devices used by management and administration; (h) web-based access and availability
twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week; (i) automated application
of policy and procedures, to make application of policy less complex and easier
to follow; (j) automated prompts and alerts when actions are due, to enable
case managers and supervisors to manage child welfare cases more efficiently;
and (k) compliance with federal regulations related to statewide automated
child welfare information systems at 45 C.F.R. 1355.50 through 1355.57, implementing
