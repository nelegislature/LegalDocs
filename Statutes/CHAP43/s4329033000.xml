However, this presumption shall not apply if there are factors mitigating against its application, including whether the other party seeking custody, parenting time, visitation, or other access is also required, as the result of a felony conviction in which the victim was a minor, to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act.</para><para>(2) Except as otherwise provided in the Nebraska Indian Child Welfare Act, no person shall be granted custody, parenting time, visitation, or other access with a child if the person has been convicted under section 28-319 or 28-320 or a law in another jurisdiction similar to either section 28-319 or 28-320 and the child was conceived as a result of that violation unless the custodial parent or guardian, as defined in section 43-245, consents.</para><para>(3) A change in circumstances relating to subsection (1) or (2) of this section is sufficient grounds for modification of a previous order.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2007, LB554, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB289, &#167; 23. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Nebraska Indian Child Welfare Act,</emphasis> see section 43-1501.</para><para><emphasis>Sex Offender Registration Act,</emphasis> see section 29-4001.</para></crossreference><annotation>
    	<para>To overcome the "bursting bubble" presumption set forth in subdivision (1)(c) of this section, a custodial parent must produce evidence that, even with a sex offender's access, the child or children are not at significant risk. If the evidence is produced, the presumption disappears and the trial court must weigh the evidence presented free from any legal presumptions. Hopkins v. Hopkins, 294 Neb. 417, 883 N.W.2d 363 (2016).</para><para>Taken together, subdivision (1)(b) and subsection (3) of this section create a statutory presumption against custody being awarded to a person residing with a person required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act due to a felony conviction in which the victim was a minor or as a result of an offense that would make it contrary to the best interests of the child whose custody is at issue, but this presumption can be overcome by evidence. Watkins v. Watkins, 285 Neb. 693, 829 N.W.2d 643 (2013).</para>
