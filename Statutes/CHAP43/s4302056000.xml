or detention; probable cause hearing; release requirements; exceptions.</catchline><para>When the court enters an order continuing placement or detention
pursuant to section 43-253, upon request of the juvenile, or his or her parent,
guardian, or attorney, the court shall hold a hearing within forty-eight hours,
at which hearing the burden of proof shall be upon the state to show probable
cause that such juvenile is within the jurisdiction of the court. Strict rules
of evidence shall not apply at the probable cause hearing. The juvenile shall
be released if probable cause is not shown. At the option of the court, it
may hold the adjudication hearing provided in section 43-279 as soon as possible
instead of the probable cause hearing if held within a reasonable period of
time. This section and section 43-255 shall not apply to a juvenile (1) who
has escaped from a commitment or (2) who has been taken into custody for his
or her own protection as provided in subdivision (2) of
section 43-248 in which case the juvenile shall be held on order of the court
with jurisdiction for a reasonable period of time.</para>
