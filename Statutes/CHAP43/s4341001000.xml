Services and to the Office of Juvenile Services, (c) eliminate
barriers preventing juveniles from receiving needed services, (d) prevent
unnecessary penetration of juveniles further into the juvenile justice system, (e) enable the juvenile's needs to be met in
the least intrusive and least restrictive manner while maintaining the safety
of the juvenile and the community, (f) reduce the duplication
of resources within the juvenile justice system through intense coordinated
case management and supervision, and (g) use evidence-based practices
and responsive case management to improve outcomes for adjudicated juveniles.</para>
