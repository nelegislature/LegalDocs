<para>Because venue is immaterial in juvenile proceedings, a court should not grant a motion to dismiss based on an allegation of improper venue. Pursuant to the statutory language, a juvenile court should first hold an adjudication hearing, and after the adjudication hearing, it should determine whether it would be proper to transfer the proceedings to a court in the county where the juvenile resides. In re Interest of Breana M., 18 Neb. App. 910, 795 N.W.2d 660 (2011).</para>
<para>This section allows an adjudication proceeding to be filed in any county and allows for discretionary transfer, after adjudication, to the county where the juvenile is living or domiciled. In re Interest of Tegan V., 18 Neb. App. 857, 794 N.W.2d 190 (2011).</para>
<para>This section makes venue immaterial in addition to setting up a procedure for discretionary transfer. In re Interest of Tegan V., 18 Neb. App. 857, 794 N.W.2d 190 (2011).</para>
