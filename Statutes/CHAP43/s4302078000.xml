<para>Neither this section nor section 43-251.01(2) prohibits a juvenile court from placing a juvenile at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center when the court has adjudicated a juvenile under section 43-247(2) and (3). In re Interest of Trey H., 281 Neb. 760, 798 N.W.2d 607 (2011).</para>
<para>When a court adjudicates a juvenile under section 43-247(2) and (3) and commits the juvenile to the Office of Juvenile Services with a placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center, it has determined that the subsection (2) adjudication will control the juvenile's disposition. The disposition determination controls which review hearing statute applies, and this section's requirement for 6-month review hearings does not authorize the court to conduct review hearings. Instead, the prohibition in section 43-408(2) of review hearings for juveniles placed at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center controls. In re Interest of Trey H., 281 Neb. 760, 798 N.W.2d 607 (2011).</para>
<para>This section and section 43-271 confer a statutory right to a prompt adjudication hearing to all juveniles within section 43-247(1), (2), (3)(b), and (4). This section and section 43-271 are directory and do not require absolute discharge of a juvenile not adjudicated within the prescribed time period. In re Interest of Brandy M. et al., 250 Neb. 510, 550 N.W.2d 17 (1996).</para><para>The statutory provision requiring that an adjudication hearing be held within six months after a juvenile petition is filed is directory, not mandatory. In re Interest of C.P., 235 Neb. 276, 455 N.W.2d 138 (1990).</para>
<para>The statutory provision requiring that an adjudication hearing be held within 90 days after a juvenile petition is filed is directory, not mandatory. In re Interest of Maxwell T., 15 Neb. App. 47, 721 N.W.2d 676 (2006).</para>
<para>Section 43-271 provides a statutory right to a prompt adjudication hearing for all juveniles, but absolute discharge for the State's failure to comply with the 6-month period is not mandated and is within the discretion of the juvenile court, taking into consideration the best interests of the juvenile, the factors set forth in section 43-271 and this section, the right of the juvenile to a prompt and fair adjudication, and the future treatment and rehabilitation of the juvenile in the event of an adjudication. In re Interest of Britny S., 11 Neb. App. 704, 659 N.W.2d 831 (2003).</para></annotation>  </law>
