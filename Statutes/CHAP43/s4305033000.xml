Every child-serving department, agency, institution, committee, court, or commission shall recognize that the jurisdiction of such department, agency, institution, committee, court, or commission in serving multiple-need children is not mutually exclusive;</para><para>(4) When children are removed from their home, permanency planning shall be the guiding philosophy. It shall be the policy of the state (a) to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child with his or her family in a timeframe appropriate to the age and developmental needs of the child so long as the best interests of the child, the health and safety of the child being of paramount concern, and the needs of the child have been given primary consideration in making a determination whether or not reunification is possible, (b) when a child cannot remain with parents, to give preference to relatives as a placement resource, and (c) to minimize the number of placement changes for children in out-of-home care so long as the needs, health, safety, and best interests of the child in care are considered; and</para><para>(5) When families cannot be reunited and when active parental involvement is absent, adoption shall be aggressively pursued. Absent the possibility of adoption other permanent settings shall be pursued. In either situation, the health, safety, and best interests of the child shall be the overriding concern. Within that context, preference shall be given to relatives for the permanent placement of the child.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1987, LB 637, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 739, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1001, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1998, LB 1041, &#167; 34. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
