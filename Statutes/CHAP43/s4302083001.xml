Generally</emphasis></para><para>A detention hearing is a parent's opportunity to be heard on the need for the removal and the satisfaction of the State's obligations under this section, and it is not optional when a child is detained for any significant period of time. In re Interest of Mainor T. &amp; Estela T., 267 Neb. 232, 674 N.W.2d 442 (2004).</para><para>A finding of a fact that excuses the requirement of reasonable efforts at reunification under subsection (4) of this section must be based on clear and convincing evidence. In re Interest of Jac'Quez N., 266 Neb. 782, 669 N.W.2d 429 (2003).</para><para>The plain language of this section contains no directive granting a parent or any other party the right to bring a motion requesting a separate hearing on the issue of reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify. The Legislature intended that the issue of reasonable efforts required under this section must be reviewed by the juvenile court (1) when removing from the home a juvenile adjudged to be under subsections (3) or (4) of section 43-247 pursuant to section 43-284, (2) when the court continues a juvenile's out-of-home placement pending adjudication pursuant to section 43-254, (3) when the court reviews a juvenile's status and permanency planning pursuant to section 43-1315, and (4) when termination of parental rights to a juvenile is sought by the State under subsection (6) of section 43-292.

App. 259, 809 N.W.2d 804 (2011).</para><para>A "parent of the juvenile" means a biological parent or a stepparent when such stepparent is married to the custodial parent as of the filing of the petition; a custodial parent's live-in boyfriend or girlfriend is not a "parent of the juvenile" for purposes of this section. In re Interest of Ethan M., 15 Neb. App. 148, 723 N.W.2d 363 (2006).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (6) of section 43-292, termination of parental rights requires a finding that following a determination that the juvenile is one as described in subsection (3)(a) of section 43-247, reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify the family if required under this section, under the direction of the court, have failed to correct the conditions leading to the determination.

App. 707, 684 N.W.2d 594 (2004).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (4)(b) of this section, clear and convincing evidence that the parent of the juvenile has committed first or second degree murder of another child of the parent, or has committed voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent, excuses the Department of Health and Human Services from the requirement to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family.

App. 567, 680 N.W.2d 221 (2004).</para><para>A finding of "felony child abuse" does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (4)(b)(iv) of this section, and there is no crime called "felony child abuse" in Nebraska.

Aggravated circumstances</emphasis></para><para>The term "aggravated circumstances," as used in subsection (4)(a) of this section, embodies the concept that the nature of the abuse or neglect must have been so severe or repetitive that to attempt reunification would jeopardize and compromise the safety of the child and would place the child in a position of an unreasonable risk to be reabused.
