own motion, a hearing may be held regarding the amenability of the juvenile
to the rehabilitative services that can be provided under the Nebraska Juvenile

finding that a juvenile is not amenable to rehabilitative services that can
be provided under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The reasons for such a finding
