for all courts to comply with the notification requirements found in this
section. The department or contract agency shall each have one telephone number
by which any court seeking to provide notice may obtain up-to-date contact
information of all persons listed in subdivisions (2)(a) through (h) of this
section. All contact information shall be up-to-date within seventy-two hours
of any placement change.</para>
<para>(2) Notice shall be provided to all of the following parties
that are applicable to the case: (a) The person charged with the care of such

full days prior to the review or hearing. The use of ordinary mail shall constitute

child by asking questions, if present at the hearing, of any willing foster
