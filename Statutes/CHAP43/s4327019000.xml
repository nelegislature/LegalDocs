If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to serve was nominated under section 43-2704, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under section 43-2704; otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under subsection (1) of section 43-2710.
