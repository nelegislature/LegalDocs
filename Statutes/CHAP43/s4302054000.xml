Detention</emphasis></para><para>A detention hearing is a parent's opportunity to be heard on the need for the removal and the satisfaction of the State's obligations under section 43-283.01, and it is not optional when a child is detained for any significant period of time.

In re Interest of R.R., 239 Neb. 250, 475 N.W.2d 518 (1991).</para><para>Although an ex parte temporary detention order keeping a juvenile's custody from his or her parent for a short period of time is not final, an order under this section and subsection (3)(a) of section 43-247 after a hearing which continues to keep a juvenile's custody from the parent pending an adjudication hearing is final and thus appealable.

App. 908, 639 N.W.2d 668 (2002).</para><para>Although an ex parte temporary detention order keeping a juvenile's custody from his or her parent for a short period of time is not final, one entered under this section, after a hearing which continues to keep a juvenile's custody from the parent pending an adjudication hearing to determine whether the juvenile is neglected, is final and thus appealable. In re Interest of Cassandra L. &amp; Trevor L., 4 Neb. App. 333, 543 N.W.2d 199 (1996).</para><para>State did not meet statutory requirements to justify child's continued detention pending adjudication where there was no evidence showing that it would be contrary to the juvenile's welfare to remain in her home pending adjudication and no evidence regarding any efforts made by the State to prevent the need to remove the child.

Burden of proof</emphasis></para><para>Continued detention pending adjudication is not permitted under the Nebraska Juvenile Code unless the State can establish by a preponderance of the evidence at an adversarial hearing that such detention is necessary for the welfare of the juvenile.

In re Interest of R.G., 238 Neb. 405, 470 N.W.2d 780 (1991).</para><para><emphasis>3. Reasonable efforts</emphasis></para><para>The Legislature intended that the issue of reasonable efforts required under section 43-283.01 must be reviewed by the juvenile court (1) when removing from the home a juvenile adjudged to be under subsections (3) or (4) of section 43-247 pursuant to section 43-284, (2) when the court continues a juvenile's out-of-home placement pending adjudication pursuant to this section, (3) when the court reviews a juvenile's status and permanency planning pursuant to section 43-1315, and (4) when termination of parental rights to a juvenile is sought by the State under subsection (6) of section 43-292. In re Interest of DeWayne G., Jr. &amp; Devon G., 263 Neb. 43, 638 N.W.2d 510 (2002).</para><para>Provision in this section which requires the State to show that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent the need for a juvenile's removal applies only when the juvenile is taken into temporary custody without a court order under the authority of section 43-248(3). Thus, where a juvenile is taken into custody pursuant to a juvenile court order, this section does not apply. A detention order issued under section 43-247(3)(a) and this section after a hearing which continues to withhold the custody of a juvenile from the parent pending an adjudication hearing to determine whether the juvenile is neglected is a final order and thus appealable. Thus, where an appeal from such an order has been perfected, a trial court is without jurisdiction to terminate parental rights until resolution of the parent's appeal from the original detention order regarding that child.
