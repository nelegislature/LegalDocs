upon all wheat sold through commercial channels in the State of Nebraska. Commencing on October 1, 2012, there is
hereby levied an excise tax of four-tenths percent of the net market value
of wheat sold through commercial channels in the State of Nebraska. The

out the intent and purposes of the Nebraska Wheat Resources Act, reduce or
increase such levy for such period as it deems justifiable, but not less than
one year, and such levy shall not exceed five-tenths percent of the net market
