money in the Nebraska Resources Development Fund may be reallocated by the
commission in accordance with sections 2-1586 to 2-1595 for utilization by
the department, by any state office, agency, board, or commission, or by any
political subdivision of the state which has the authority to develop the
state's water and related land resources after March 30, 2014. The commission
may commit appropriated funds to projects approved as of March 30, 2014, not
to exceed amounts specifically allocated to such projects prior to March 30,
2014. Prior to March 30, 2014, the fund may be allocated in the
form of grants or loans or for acquiring state interests in water and related
land resources programs and projects undertaken within the state. The allocation
of funds to a program or project in one form shall not of itself preclude
additional allocations in the same or any other form to the same program or
project. Funds may also be allocated to assist natural resources districts
in the preparation of management plans as provided in section 46-709. Funds
so allocated shall not be subject to sections 2-1589 to 2-1595.</para>
<para>(2) No project, including all related phases, segments, parts, or divisions,
shall receive more than ten million dollars from the fund. On July 1 of each

of this subsection by an amount equal to the average percentage change in
a readily available construction cost index for the prior three years.</para>

shall be made to the Governor and the Clerk of the Legislature describing

preceding two-year period. The report submitted to the Clerk of the Legislature
shall be submitted electronically. The report shall include a complete financial

of such report upon making a request to the director.</para>
