The Legislature further finds that the completion of modern soil surveys can be most appropriately accomplished by accelerating, in a manner deemed appropriate by the department, state financial input into the combined state and federal effort currently being conducted cooperatively by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Conservation and Survey Division of the University of Nebraska. It is therefor the intent of this Legislature to embark upon an accelerated program for the completion of Nebraska's modern soil surveys and to recommend that the State of Nebraska and the Legislature appropriate the funds necessary to carry out this accelerated program during the years required for its completion.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1976, LB 180, &#167; 1; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1977), &#167; 2-3273; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 403, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 900, &#167; 40.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
