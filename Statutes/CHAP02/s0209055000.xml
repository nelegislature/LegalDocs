Such methods may include definite systems of tillage, cropping, management, and use of livestock.</para><para>Each control authority shall use one or both of the following forms for all individual notices: (i)</para><para>.................

Such notice shall be published weekly for four successive weeks prior to May 1 of each year or at such other times as the control authority deems necessary. In no event shall a fine be assessed against a landowner as prescribed in subdivision (3)(a) of this section unless the control authority has caused individual notice to be served upon the landowner as specified in this subdivision.</para><para>(2) At the request of any owner served with an individual notice pursuant to subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this section, the control authority shall hold an informal public hearing to allow such landowner an opportunity to be heard on the question of the existence of an uncontrolled noxious weed infestation on such landowner's property.</para><para>(3) Whenever the owner of the land on which noxious weeds are present has neglected or failed to control them as required pursuant to the act and any notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the control authority having jurisdiction shall proceed as follows:</para><para>(a) If, within fifteen days from the date specified on the notice required by subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this section, the owner has not taken action to control the noxious weeds on the specified property and has not requested a hearing pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the control authority shall notify the county attorney who shall proceed against such owner as prescribed in this subdivision.

The cost of any such control shall be at the expense of the owner. In addition the control authority shall immediately cause notice to be filed of possible unpaid weed control assessments against the property upon which the control measures were used in the register of deeds office in the county where the property is located. If unpaid for two months, the control authority shall certify to the county treasurer the amount of such expense and such expense shall become a lien on the property upon which the control measures were taken as a special assessment levied on the date of control. The county treasurer shall add such expense to and it shall become and form a part of the taxes upon such land and shall bear interest at the same rate as taxes.</para><para>Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit satisfaction of the obligation imposed hereby in whole or in part by tax foreclosure proceedings. The expense may be collected by suit instituted for that purpose as a debt due the county or by any other or additional remedy otherwise available.
