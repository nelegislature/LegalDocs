To the extent any member of the board of directors or the administrator of the corporation is already covered by a bond required by state law, such member or the administrator need not obtain another bond so long as the bond required by the state law is in at least the penal sum specified in this section and covers the activities for the corporation by the member or administrator. In lieu of such bond, the administrator may execute a blanket surety bond covering each member and the administrator. Each surety bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the member or administrator, and shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state as surety. At all times after the issuance of any surety bond, each member and the administrator shall maintain such surety bonds in full force and effect. All costs of the surety bonds shall be borne by the corporation.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1981, LB 385, &#167; 12.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
