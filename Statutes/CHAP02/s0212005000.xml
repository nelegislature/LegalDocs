The license shall set forth the name of the licensee, the place where the races or race meetings are to be held, and the time and number of days during which racing may be conducted by such licensee. Any such license issued shall not be transferable or assignable. The commission shall have the power to revoke any license issued at any time for good cause upon reasonable notice and hearing. No license shall be granted to any corporation or association except upon the express condition that it shall not, by any lease, contract, understanding, or arrangement of whatever kind or nature, grant, assign, or turn over to any person, corporation, or association the operation or management of any racing or race meeting licensed under such sections or of the parimutuel system of wagering described in section 2-1207 or in any manner permit any person, corporation, or association other than the licensee to have any share, percentage, or proportion of the money received for admissions to the racing or race meeting or from the operation of the parimutuel system; and any violation of such conditions shall authorize and require the commission immediately to revoke such license.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1935, c. 173, &#167; 5, p. 631; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 2-1505; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 2-1205; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 599, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 1041, &#167; 3.</para></source><annotation><para>Because a relicensure decision would involve a consideration of any rule violations by an equine veterinarian during prior periods of licensure, it is reasonable and consistent with the State Racing Commission's statutory purpose to promptly investigate and resolve alleged rule violations committed during a period of licensure, even if the process of doing so extends into a period when the subject is not licensed.
