When appropriate, a pesticide management plan may establish action levels for imposition of such progressively more rigorous management practices based upon measurable indicators of the adverse effect on humans or the environment;</para><para>(4) To adopt and promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary for the enforcement and administration of the Pesticide Act.
