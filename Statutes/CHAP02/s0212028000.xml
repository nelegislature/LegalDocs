An application for such license shall be in a form prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information, material, or evidence as the commission may require. Any racetrack issued an interstate simulcast facility license may conduct the interstate simulcast of any horserace permitted under its license, and parimutuel wagering shall be allowed on such horserace. The commission shall not authorize interstate simulcasting for any racetrack pursuant to sections 2-1201 to 2-1223 unless all of the thoroughbred racetracks together applied for and received authority to conduct at least one hundred eighty live racing days in the calendar year in which the application is made. If any racetrack conducts live racing for less than seventy percent of the days assigned such racetrack in 1988, (a) such racetrack shall be precluded from conducting interstate simulcasts and (b) the number of live racing days conducted by such racetrack shall be subtracted from an amount equal to seventy percent of all the days assigned such racetrack in 1988 and the amount remaining shall be deducted from the one-hundred-eighty-day total required by this section. If any racetrack ceases to conduct live racing, seventy percent of the days assigned such racetrack in 1988 shall be deducted from the one-hundred-eighty-day total required by this section.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1989, LB 591, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 471, &#167; 3.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
