death in the line of duty; beneficiaries; retirement benefits.</catchline>
<para>When prior to retirement any police officer dies
in the line of duty or his or her death is caused
by or is the result of injuries received while in the line of duty and if
such police officer is not survived by a spouse or by minor children, the
entire retirement value shall be payable to the beneficiary specified by the
deceased police officer prior to his or her death or to the deceased police
officer's estate if no beneficiary was specified. The retirement value or
portion thereof to be received by the beneficiary may be paid in the form
of a single lump-sum payment, straight life annuity, or other optional form
of benefit specified in the retirement system's funding medium. For a police
officer who is survived by a spouse or minor children, a retirement pension
of fifty percent of regular pay shall be paid to the surviving spouse or,
upon his or her remarriage or death, to the minor children during each child's
minority subject to deduction of the amounts paid as workers' compensation
benefits on account of death as provided in section 16-1012. Each such child
shall share equally in the total pension benefit to the age of his or her
majority, except that as soon as a child attains the age of majority, such
pension as to such child shall cease. Any payments for the benefit of a minor
child shall be made on behalf of such child to the surviving parent or, if
there is no surviving parent, to the legal guardian of the child. To the extent
that the retirement value at the date of death exceeds the amount required
to purchase or provide the specified retirement pension, as reduced by any
amounts paid as workers' compensation benefits, the excess shall be paid in
the manner provided in subsection (1) of section 16-1009. If the actuarial
equivalent of the pension benefit payable to a surviving spouse or minor children
under this section exceeds the retirement value at the time of the first payment,
the city shall contribute such additional amount as may be necessary to purchase
or provide for the required pension benefit.</para>
