different forms or at different times determined as of a given date as adopted
by the city or the retirement committee for use by the retirement system. Actuarial equivalencies shall
be specified in the funding medium established for the retirement system,
except that if benefits under the retirement system are obtained through the
purchase of an annuity contract, the actuarial equivalency of any such form
of benefit shall be the amount of pension benefit which can be purchased or
otherwise provided by such contract. All actuarial and mortality assumptions
adopted by the city or retirement committee shall be on a sex-neutral basis;</para>
<para>(2) Annuity contract means the
contract or contracts issued by one or more life insurance companies or designated

to the approval of the city, to hold or invest the funds of the retirement
system;</para>
<para>(5) Regular interest means the
rate of interest earned each calendar year commencing January 1, 1984, equal
to the rate of net earnings realized for the calendar year from investments
of the retirement fund. Net earnings means the

fund exceeds the amount of any realized losses from such investments during
the calendar year. The retirement committee shall annually report the amount

The retirement value at any time shall consist of the sum of the contributions
made or transferred to such accounts by the firefighter and by the city on
the firefighter's behalf and the regular interest credited to the accounts
through such date, reduced by any realized losses which were not taken into
account in determining regular interest in any year, and as further adjusted
each year to reflect the accounts' pro rata share of the appreciation or depreciation
of the assets of the retirement system as determined by the retirement committee
at their fair market values, including any account under subsection (2) of
section 16-1036. Such valuation shall be undertaken at least annually as of
December 31 of each year and at such other times as may be directed by the
retirement committee. The value of each account shall be reduced each year
by the appropriate share of the investment costs as provided in section 16-1036.01.

<para>(11) Sex-neutral
basis means the benefit calculation provided to the city of the first class
by a licensed domestic or foreign insurance or annuity company with a product
available for purchase in Nebraska that utilizes a blended, non-gender-specific
rate for actuarial assumptions, mortality assumptions, and annuity conversion
rates for a particular participant, except that if a blended, non-gender-specific
rate is not available for purchase in Nebraska, the benefit calculation shall
be performed using the arithmetic mean of the male-specific actuarial assumptions,
mortality assumptions, or annuity conversion rates and the female-specific
actuarial assumptions, mortality assumptions, or annuity conversion rates,
as applicable, for a particular participant, and the arithmetic mean shall
be determined by adding the male-specific actuarial assumptions, mortality
assumptions, or annuity conversion rates to the female-specific actuarial
assumptions, mortality assumptions, or annuity conversion rates applicable
to a particular participant and dividing the sum by two; and</para>
