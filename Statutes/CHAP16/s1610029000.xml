The retirement value or portion thereof may be received by the beneficiary in the form of a single lump-sum payment, a straight life annuity, or any other optional form of benefit specified in the retirement system's funding medium. In the event benefits are paid in the form of an annuity, such annuity shall be the amount provided by the annuity contract purchased or otherwise provided by the amount of retirement value to be paid to the beneficiary as of the date of the first payment. Upon the payment of a lump-sum distribution or the purchase and distribution of such annuity contract to the beneficiary, all obligations of the retirement system to the beneficiary shall terminate, without exception.</para><para>(2) If any firefighter employed by such city as a member of its paid fire department on January 1, 1984, and any firefighter reemployed thereafter who, while employed in such department entered military service and is still in military service, dies while employed by the city as a firefighter other than in the line of duty after becoming fifty years of age and before electing to retire, and after serving in the paid fire department of such city for at least twenty-one years, then a pension of at least twenty-five percent of his or her regular pay as defined in section 16-1021, in the form of a straight life annuity, shall be paid to the surviving spouse or minor children of such deceased firefighter.
