The city may require the owner or occupant of all lots and pieces of ground within the city to keep the lots and pieces of ground and the adjoining streets and alleys free of excessive growth of weeds, grasses, or worthless vegetation, and may prohibit and control the throwing, depositing, or accumulation of litter on any lot or piece of ground within the city or within the city's extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction.</para><para>(2) Any city of the first class may by ordinance declare it to be a nuisance to permit or maintain excessive growth of weeds, grasses, or worthless vegetation or to litter or cause litter to be deposited or remain thereon except in proper receptacles. The city shall establish by ordinance the height at which weeds, grasses, or worthless vegetation are a nuisance.</para><para>(3) Any owner or occupant of a lot or piece of ground shall, upon conviction of violating any ordinance authorized under this section, be guilty of a Class V misdemeanor.</para><para>(4) Notice to abate and remove such nuisance shall be given to each owner or owner's duly authorized agent and to the occupant, if any.
