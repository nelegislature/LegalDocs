On opening of bids for paving or repaving in any such district, the mayor and city council shall postpone action thereon for a period of not less than ten days. During such period of postponement, the owners of the record title representing a majority of the abutting property owners in a district may file with the city clerk a petition for the use of a particular material for paving for which a bid has been received, in which event a bid on that material shall be accepted and the work shall be done with that material.
