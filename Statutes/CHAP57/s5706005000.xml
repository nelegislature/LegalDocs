Such finding shall not of itself be a basis for compensation to be paid to the condemnee. If at the time of the condemner's filing with the commission native gas from the underground reservoir is being used for the secondary recovery of oil, then gas in necessary and required amounts shall be furnished to the operator or operators of the secondary recovery operations at equivalent costs, for so long as oil is produced in paying quantities in the secondary recovery operations, but the amount of gas to be furnished hereunder shall not exceed the quantity of recoverable native gas found to exist in the reservoir at the time of its acquisition hereunder if such operator was or operators were at such time entitled to the whole thereof, but if it was or they were at such time entitled to less than the whole thereof, then not to exceed the quantity thereof to which such operator was or operators were then entitled. The commission shall issue no such certificate until after public hearing is had on application and upon reasonable notice to interested parties. The applicant shall be assessed and pay all the costs of the proceedings incurred with the commission. Any person having an interest in the property affected by a finding of the commission or the condemner may appeal the issuance or denial of certificate or from any finding as to the amount of commercially recoverable native gas, and the appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1953, c. 191, &#167; 3(3), p. 615; </para><para>Laws 1963, c. 325, &#167; 4, p. 985; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 352, &#167; 100. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Administrative Procedure Act,</emphasis> see section 84-920.</para></crossreference></law></legaldoc>
