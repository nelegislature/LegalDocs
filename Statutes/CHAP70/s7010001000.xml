The determination on the timing and form of competitive markets is a matter properly left to the states as each state must evaluate the costs and benefits of a competitive retail market based on its own unique conditions. Consequently, there is a need for the state to monitor whether the conditions necessary for its citizens to benefit from retail competition exist.</para><para>It is also the policy of the state to encourage and allow opportunities for private developers to develop, own, and operate renewable energy facilities intended for sale at wholesale under a statutory framework which protects the ratepayers of consumer-owned utility systems operating in the state from subsidizing the costs of such export facilities through their rates.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1963, c. 397, &#167; 1, p. 1259; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 349, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 181, &#167; 42; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 901, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 2010, LB1048, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2016, LB824, &#167; 2. </para></source><annotation><para>Public policy underlying encouragement of publicly owned electric utilities is to provide power to consumers at reasonable rates at as low overall cost as possible and to avoid duplication of facilities.
