For time expended in his or her duties in such position of trust, the director shall not be limited to any existing provisions of law of this state relating to payment of per diem for services as a member of such board of directors, but shall be entitled to receive such additional compensation as may be provided for such service, regardless of the fact that such compensation may be paid from funds to which his or her district has made contributions in the form of dues or otherwise.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1933, c. 86, &#167; 5, p. 345; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 70-705; </para><para>Laws 1943, c. 146, &#167; 2(1), p. 520; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 70-624; </para><para>Laws 1944, Spec.
