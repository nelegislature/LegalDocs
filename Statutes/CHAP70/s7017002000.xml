A purchase agreement may contain such terms and conditions as the public entity may determine, including provisions whereby the public entity agrees to accept and pay for additional power generated by a project if another public entity that is a purchaser of power from the same project defaults or otherwise is unable to take or pay for such power. A purchase agreement may further provide that the public entity is obligated to make payments regardless of whether power is provided, produced, or delivered to the public entity or whether the project contemplated by a purchase agreement is completed, operable, or operating, and notwithstanding suspension, interruption, interference, reduction, or curtailment of the output of power from such project.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2004, LB 969, &#167; 2. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
