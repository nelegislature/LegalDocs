The request of such city or village shall be exercised by a resolution duly adopted by its governing body. Such resolution shall not become effective until thirty days' notice of the adoption thereof shall have been given by the governing body by publication once each week for three successive weeks in some legal newspaper published and of general circulation in such city or village, or if no such newspaper is published therein, then by posting in five or more public places therein.

If a majority of the voters voting on the issue vote against such resolution, the resolution shall not become effective. If no such petitions are filed, the resolution shall become effective at the expiration of such thirty-day period. In the absence of an agreement between any city or village and the public power district, the city or village may at any time determine what shall be included in the term distribution system by a declaratory judgment in which the public power district or public power and irrigation district owning the distribution system shall be joined.
