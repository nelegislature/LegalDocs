election; subdivisions; procedure.</catchline><para>(1)(a) Subject to the provisions
of Chapter 70, article 6, and subject to the approval of the Nebraska Power
Review Board, the board of directors of a district, other than a district with a service area containing a
city of the metropolitan class, may amend the petition for its
creation to provide for the division of the territory of such district into
two or more subdivisions for the nomination and election of some or all of
the directors. Each subdivision shall be composed of one or more voting precincts,
or divided voting precincts, and the total population of each such subdivision
shall be approximately the same. Except in districts which contain a city
of the metropolitan class, two or more subdivisions may be combined
for election purposes, and members of the board of directors to be elected
from such combined subdivisions may be nominated and elected at large when
not less than seventy-five percent of the population of the combined subdivisions
is within the corporate limits of any city.</para>
<para>(b) In the event a district
formed includes all or part of two or more counties and is (i) engaged
in furnishing electric light and power and more than fifty percent of its
customers are rural customers or (ii) engaged in furnishing
electric light and power and in the business of owning and operating irrigation
works, then and in that event such subdivisions may be formed by following
precinct or county boundary lines without regard to population if in the judgment
of the Nebraska Power Review Board the interests of the rural users of electricity
or of users of irrigation water service in such district will not be prejudiced
thereby.</para>
<para>(2)(a) The
board of directors of a district with a service area containing a city of
the metropolitan class may amend its charter to provide for the division of
the territory of the district into election subdivisions composed of substantially
equal population and compact and contiguous territory and number the subdivisions
consecutively and submit the maps to the Nebraska Power Review Board.</para>
<para>(b) If the
board of directors provides for eight election subdivisions prior to January
1, 2014, the board of directors shall assign each position on the board of
directors to represent a numbered election subdivision for the remainder of
the term of office for which the member is elected, regardless of whether
the member resides in the subdivision, and shall make such assignments so
that the terms of members representing election subdivisions numbered one,
two, and three expire in January 2015, the terms of members representing election
subdivisions numbered four and five expire in January 2017, and the terms
of members representing election subdivisions six, seven, and eight expire
in January 2019. If possible, each member shall be assigned to represent an
election subdivision that corresponds to the end of the term he or she is
serving.</para><para>(c) A successor who resides in the numbered election subdivision
shall be nominated and elected at the statewide primary and general elections
held in the calendar year prior to the expiration of the term of the member
who represents such numbered election subdivision.</para><para>(3) After each federal
decennial census, the board of directors of a district with a service area
containing a city of the metropolitan class shall create new boundaries for
the election subdivisions. In establishing the boundaries of the election
subdivisions, the board of directors shall follow county lines wherever practicable,
shall provide for the subdivisions to be composed of substantially equal population
and compact and contiguous territory, and shall, as nearly as possible, follow
the precinct lines created by the election commissioner or county clerk after
each federal decennial census.</para><para>(4) Any public power district or public power
and irrigation district owning and operating irrigation works may, with approval
of the Nebraska Power Review Board, add representation on its board of directors
from any county which is outside its chartered territory but in which is located
some or all of such irrigation works.</para>
