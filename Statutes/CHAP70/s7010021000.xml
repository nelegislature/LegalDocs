Before such microwave construction is authorized, the Nebraska Power Review Board shall find (1) that in the judgment of the board the district is not receiving the required quality of service, and will not within a reasonable time receive the required quality of service from the regulated carrier or carriers involved, or (2) that the regulated carriers would not provide the required quality of service by the same or alternate methods, at the same or lower costs to the district, and (3) that such construction would be in the public interest. Upon the filing of an application to construct microwave communication facilities under this section, the board shall give notice thereof by mail to any regulated carrier or carriers involved.
