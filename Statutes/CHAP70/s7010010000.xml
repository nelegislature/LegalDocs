If the parties cannot agree upon the value, then the board shall determine the total economic impact on the selling supplier and establish the price accordingly based on, but not limited to, the following guidelines: The supplier acquiring the certified service area, distribution facilities, and customers shall purchase the electric distribution facilities of the supplier located within the affected area, together with the supplier's rights to serve within such area, for cash consideration which shall consist of (a) the current reproduction cost if the facilities being acquired were new, less depreciation computed on a straight-line basis at three percent per year not to exceed seventy percent, plus (b) an amount equal to the nonbetterment cost of constructing any facilities necessary to reintegrate the system of the supplier outside the area being transferred after detaching the portion to be sold, plus (c) an amount equal to two and one-half times the annual revenue received from power sales to existing customers of electric power within the area being transferred, except that for large commercial or industrial customers with peak demands of three hundred kilowatts or greater during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of filing with the board, the multiple shall be five times the net revenue, defined as gross power sales, less costs of wholesale power including facilities rental charges, received from power sales to large commercial or industrial customers with measured demand of three hundred kilowatts or greater during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing with the board for service area modification. After the board has determined the price in accordance with such guidelines, the acquiring supplier may acquire such distribution facilities and customers by payment of the established price within one year of the final order.</para><para>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 70-1008 to 70-1010, no transfer of facilities and customers shall be made or approved by the board if such transfer would impair the obligations of a power supplier to holders of its bonds or mortgages.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1963, c. 397, &#167; 10, p. 1263; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 223, &#167; 4. </para></source><annotation><para>"Reintegration" for the purposes of this section means "'to restore to unity after disintegration'" and is distinct from any accompanying loss of revenue that might be associated with a loss of load following a transfer of electrical services under section 70-1008 and this section.
