members of the authority shall constitute a quorum. The affirmative vote of
a majority of all of the members of the authority shall be necessary for any
action taken by the authority. A vacancy in the membership of the authority
shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform
all the duties of the authority. Any action taken by the authority under the
Nebraska Educational, Health,
and Social Services Finance Authority Act may be authorized by
resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall
take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. Members of the authority may participate in a regular or
special meeting of the authority by telephone conference call or videoconference
as long as the chairperson or vice-chairperson conducts the meeting at a location
where the public is able to participate by attendance at that location and
the telephone conference call or videoconference otherwise conforms to the
requirements of subdivisions (2)(a) through (e) of section 84-1411.</para>
