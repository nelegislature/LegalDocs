Such a notice of additional tax due shall not be considered a notice of deficiency assessment nor shall the taxpayer have any right of protest or appeal as in the case of a deficiency assessment based on such notice, and the assessment and collection of the amount of tax erroneously omitted in the return is not prohibited.
