Within thirty days from the date the county assessor certifies the amount of the refund, the county treasurer shall notify each political subdivision, including any school district receiving a distribution pursuant to section 79-1073 and any land bank receiving real property taxes pursuant to subdivision (3)(a) of section 18-3411, of its respective share of the refund, except that for any political subdivision whose share of the refund is two hundred dollars or less, the county board may waive this notice requirement. Notification shall be by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the last-known address of record of the political subdivision. The county treasurer shall pay the refund from funds in his or her possession belonging to any political subdivision, including any school district receiving a distribution pursuant to section 79-1073 and any land bank receiving real property taxes pursuant to subdivision (3)(a) of section 18-3411, which received any part of the tax or penalty being refunded. If sufficient funds are not available or the political subdivision, within thirty days of the mailing of the notice by the county treasurer if applicable, certifies to the county treasurer that a hardship would result and create a serious interference with its governmental functions if the refund of the tax or penalty is paid, the county treasurer shall register the refund or portion thereof which remains unpaid as a claim against such political subdivision and shall issue the person entitled to the refund a receipt for the registration of the claim. The certification by a political subdivision declaring a hardship shall be binding upon the county treasurer;</para><para>(2) The refund of a tax or penalty or the receipt for the registration of a claim made or issued pursuant to this section shall be satisfied in full as soon as practicable and in no event later than five years from the date the final order or other action approving a refund is entered. The governing body of the political subdivision shall make provisions in its budget for the amount of any refund or claim to be satisfied pursuant to this section. If a receipt for the registration of a claim is given:</para><para>(a) Such receipt shall be applied to satisfy any tax levied or assessed by that political subdivision next falling due from the person holding the receipt after the sixth next succeeding levy is made on behalf of the political subdivision following the final order or other action approving the refund; and</para><para>(b) To the extent the amount of such receipt exceeds the amount of such tax liability, the unsatisfied balance of the receipt shall be paid and satisfied within the five-year period prescribed in this subdivision from a combination of a credit against taxes anticipated to be due to the political subdivision during such period and cash payment from any funds expected to accrue to the political subdivision pursuant to a written plan to be filed by the political subdivision with the county treasurer no later than thirty days after the claim against the political subdivision is first reduced by operation of a credit against taxes due to such political subdivision.</para><para>If a political subdivision fails to fully satisfy the refund or claim prior to the sixth next succeeding levy following the entry of a final nonappealable order or other action approving a refund, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance commencing on the sixth next succeeding levy following such entry or action at the rate set forth in section 45-103;</para><para>(3) The county treasurer shall mail the refund or the receipt by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the last-known address of the person entitled thereto. Multiple refunds to the same person may be combined into one refund or credit. If a refund is not claimed by June 1 of the year following the year of mailing, the refund shall be canceled and the resultant amount credited to the various funds originally charged;</para><para>(4) When the refund involves property valued by the state, the Tax Commissioner shall be authorized to negotiate a settlement of the amount of the refund or claim due pursuant to this section on behalf of the political subdivision from which such refund or claim is due. Any political subdivision which does not agree with the settlement terms as negotiated may reject such terms, and the refund or claim due from the political subdivision then shall be satisfied as set forth in this section as if no such negotiation had occurred;</para><para>(5) In the event that the Legislature appropriates state funds to be disbursed for the purposes of satisfying all or any portion of any refund or claim, the Tax Commissioner shall order the county treasurer to disburse such refund amounts directly to the persons entitled to the refund in partial or total satisfaction of such persons' claims. The county treasurer shall disburse such amounts within forty-five days after receipt thereof; and</para><para>(6) If all or any portion of the refund is reduced by way of settlement or forgiveness by the person entitled to the refund, the proportionate amount of the refund that was paid by an appropriation of state funds shall be reimbursed by the county treasurer to the State Treasurer within forty-five days after receipt of the settlement agreement or receipt of the forgiven refund. The amount so reimbursed shall be credited to the General Fund.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1991, LB 829, &#167; 15; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 1063, &#167; 138; </para><para>Laws 1992, Second Spec.
