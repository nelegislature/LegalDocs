If the eligible charitable organization does not receive the contribution within the required time period, it shall notify the department of such fact and the department shall no longer include such amount when calculating whether the limit prescribed in subsection (3) of this section has been exceeded. If the eligible charitable organization receives the contribution within the required time period, it shall provide the taxpayer with a receipt for the contribution. The receipt shall show the name and address of the eligible charitable organization, the name, address, and, if available, tax identification number of the taxpayer making the contribution, the amount of the contribution, and the date the contribution was received.</para><para>(3) The department shall consider notifications regarding intended tax credit amounts in the order in which they are received to ascertain whether the intended tax credit amounts are within the annual limit provided in this subsection. The annual limit on the total amount of tax credits for fiscal year 2025-26 shall be five hundred thousand dollars. The annual limit on the total amount of tax credits for fiscal year 2026-27 and each fiscal year thereafter shall be one million dollars.
