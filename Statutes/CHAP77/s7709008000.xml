A captive insurer authorized under the Captive Insurers Act that is transacting business in this state shall, on or before March 1 of each year, pay to the director a tax of one-fourth of one percent of the gross amount of direct writing premiums received by such insurer during the preceding calendar year for business transacted in the state. The taxable premiums shall include premiums paid on the lives of persons residing in this state and premiums paid for risks located in this state whether the insurance was written in this state or not, including that portion of a group premium paid which represents the premium for insurance on Nebraska residents or risks located in Nebraska included within the group when the number of lives in the group exceeds five hundred. The tax shall also apply to premiums received by domestic companies for insurance written on individuals residing outside this state or risks located outside this state if no comparable tax is paid by the direct writing domestic company to any other appropriate taxing authority. Companies whose scheme of operation contemplates the return of a portion of premiums to policyholders, without such policyholders being claimants under the terms of their policies, may deduct such return premiums or dividends from their gross premiums for the purpose of tax calculations. Any such insurance company shall receive a credit on the tax imposed as provided in the Community Development Assistance Act, the Nebraska Job Creation and Mainstreet Revitalization Act, the New Markets Job Growth Investment Act, and the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1951, c. 256, &#167; 2, p. 878; </para><para>Laws 1984, LB 372, &#167; 13; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 1114, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 1989, LB 92, &#167; 275; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 1063, &#167; 91; </para><para>Laws 1992, Second Spec.
