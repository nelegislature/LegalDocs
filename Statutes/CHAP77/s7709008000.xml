and accident insurance the rate of such tax shall be five-tenths of one percent and (2) for property and casualty insurance,
excluding individual sickness and accident insurance, the rate of such tax
shall be one percent. A captive insurer authorized under the Captive Insurers
Act that is transacting business in this state shall, on or before March 1
of each year, pay to the director a tax of one-fourth of one percent of the
gross amount of direct writing premiums received by such insurer during the
preceding calendar year for business transacted in the state. The taxable
premiums shall include premiums paid on the lives of persons residing in this
state and premiums paid for risks located in this state whether the insurance
was written in this state or not, including that portion of a group premium
paid which represents the premium for insurance on Nebraska residents or risks
located in Nebraska included within the group when the number of lives in
the group exceeds five hundred. The tax shall also apply to premiums received
by domestic companies for insurance written on individuals residing outside
this state or risks located outside this state if no comparable tax is paid
by the direct writing domestic company to any other appropriate taxing authority.
Companies whose scheme of operation contemplates the return of a portion of
premiums to policyholders, without such policyholders being claimants under
the terms of their policies, may deduct such return premiums or dividends
from their gross premiums for the purpose of tax calculations. Any such insurance
company shall receive a credit on the tax imposed as provided in the Community
Development Assistance Act.</para>
