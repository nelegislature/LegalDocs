The Legislature recognizes that the present budgeting system fails to accurately and totally reflect the revenue lost due to such tax expenditures and that as a result undetermined amounts of potential revenue are escaping public or legislative scrutiny. The loss of such potential revenue causes a narrowing of the tax base which in turn forces higher tax rates on the remaining tax base.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1979, LB 17, &#167; 2; </para><para>R.S.Supp.,1979, &#167; 77-354; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 834, &#167; 21. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
