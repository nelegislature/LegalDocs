<para>(4) The petition for redetermination shall be accompanied
by the payment of the tax or suitable security for the payment of the tax.</para>

for the redetermination and the appropriate security within the ten-day time
period.</para>
<para>(7) When a petition for redetermination and the appropriate

Commissioner becomes final.</para>
<para>(8) If the amount of the deficiency determined under such
sections is not paid upon the receipt of the notice, the deficiency shall

deems necessary to insure payment of the liability but not more than twice
the liability.</para>

in such property, the district court may grant an injunction to prohibit the
enforcement of such levy or to prohibit such sale.</para>
