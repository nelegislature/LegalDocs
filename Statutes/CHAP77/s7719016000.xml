proceedings; surplus proceeds; disposition; prorating.</catchline><para>If
a surplus remains after satisfying all costs and taxes against any particular
item of real property, the excess shall be applied in the manner provided
by law for the disposition of the surplus in the foreclosure of mortgages
on real property. If the proceeds are insufficient to pay the costs and all
the taxes, when the plaintiff is a governmental subdivision other
than a land bank or is a municipal corporation or a drainage or irrigation district, the
amount remaining shall be prorated among the governmental subdivisions, municipal
corporations, and drainage or irrigation districts in the proportion of their
interest in the decree of foreclosure. The proceeds of the sale of one item
of real property shall not be applied to the discharge of a lien for taxes
against another item of real property except when so directed by the decree
for foreclosure under the circumstances set forth in section 77-1910. The
lien on real estate for special assessments levied by any sanitary and improvement
district shall not be entitled to any surplus unless such special assessments
have been previously offered for sale by the county treasurer.</para>
