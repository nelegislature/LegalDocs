If in any suit upon the bonds of any such officer or person, he or his sureties, or any of them, shall not for any reason be liable upon the bond, the court may, nevertheless, give judgment against such officer and such of his sureties as are liable, for the amount he or they may be liable to pay, without regard to the form of the action or pleadings.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1903, c. 73, &#167; 188, p. 457; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 6516; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 6044; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 77-1949; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 77-1765.</para></source><annotation><para>Suit is proper when duty to deliver money is purely ministerial.
