When the aggregate amount required to be deducted and withheld by any employer or payor for either the first or second month of a calendar quarter exceeds five hundred dollars, the employer or payor shall, by the fifteenth day of the succeeding month, pay over such aggregate amount to the Tax Commissioner or to a depositary designated by the Tax Commissioner. The amount so paid shall be allowed as a credit against the liability shown on the employer's or payor's quarterly withholding return required by this section. The Tax Commissioner may, by rule and regulation, provide for the filing of returns and the payment of the tax deducted and withheld on other than a quarterly basis.</para><para>(2) When the aggregate amount required to be deducted and withheld by any employer or payor for the entire calendar year is less than five hundred dollars or the employer or payor is allowed to file federal withholding returns annually, the employer or payor shall, for each calendar year, on or before the last day of the month following the close of such calendar year, file a withholding return as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner and pay over to the Tax Commissioner or to a depositary designated by the Tax Commissioner the taxes so required to be deducted and withheld in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The employer or payor may elect or the Tax Commissioner may require the filing of returns and the payment of taxes on a quarterly basis.</para><para>(3) Whenever any employer or payor fails to collect, truthfully account for, pay over, or make returns of the income tax as required by this section, the Tax Commissioner may serve a notice requiring such employer or payor to collect the taxes which become collectible after service of such notice, to deposit such taxes in a bank approved by the Tax Commissioner in a separate account in trust for and payable to the Tax Commissioner, and to keep the amount of such tax in such account until paid over to the Tax Commissioner. Such notice shall remain in effect until a notice of cancellation is served by the Tax Commissioner.</para><para>(4) Any employer or payor may appoint an agent in accordance with section 3504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the purpose of withholding, reporting, or making payment of amounts withheld on behalf of the employer or payor. The agent shall be considered an employer or payor for purposes of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and, with the actual employer or payor, shall be jointly and severally liable for any amount required to be withheld and paid over to the Tax Commissioner and any additions to tax, penalties, and interest with respect thereto.</para><para>(5) The employer or payor shall also file on or before January 31 of the succeeding year a copy of each statement furnished by such employer or payor to each employee or payee with respect to taxes withheld on wages or payments subject to withholding. Any employer, payor, or agent who furnished more than fifty statements for a year shall file the required copies electronically in a manner approved by the Tax Commissioner that is compatible with federal electronic filing requirements or methods.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1967, c. 487, &#167; 56, p. 1596; </para><para>Laws 1984, LB 962, &#167; 21; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 1064, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 62, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 216, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB223, &#167; 13; </para><para>Laws 2010, LB879, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB217, &#167; 16. </para></source></law>
