Notice</emphasis></para><para>Because of the statutory time limits placed upon the State Board of Equalization by sections 77-505, 77-509, and 77-1514, R.R.S.1943, the five-day notice provision of section 77-508, R.R.S.1943, is reasonable. Where a notice of hearing was sent out and amended the next day without changing the hearing date, the date of the first notice is used to determine if the notice requirement of this section was met.
