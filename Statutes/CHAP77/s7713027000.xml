All sales shall be deemed to be arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques.

The comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in establishing assessed valuations.</para><para>(4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed in subsection (3) of this section.</para><para>(5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate.
