petitions; orders authorized.</catchline><para>(1) In resolving
an appeal or petition, the commission may make such orders as are appropriate
for resolving the dispute but in no case shall the relief be excessive compared
to the problems addressed. The commission may make prospective orders requiring
changes in assessment practices which will improve assessment practices or
affect the general level of assessment or the measures of central tendency
in a positive way. If no other relief is adequate to resolve disputes, the
commission may order a reappraisal of property within a county, an area within
a county, or classes or subclasses of property within a county.</para>
<para>(2) In an appeal specified in subdivision (10) or (11) of section 77-5016 for which the commission
determines exempt property to be taxable, the commission shall order the county
board of equalization to determine the taxable value of the property, unless
the parties stipulate to such taxable value during the hearing before the
commission. The order shall require the county board of equalization to determine the taxable value of the property
pursuant to section 77-1507, send notice of the taxable value pursuant to
section 77-1507 within ninety days after the date the commission's order is
certified pursuant to section 77-5018, and apply interest at the rate specified in section 45-104.01,
but not penalty, to the taxable value as of the date the commission's order
was issued or the date the taxes were delinquent, whichever is later.</para>

made by the county board of equalization pursuant to subsection (2) of this
section may be appealed to the commission within thirty days after the board's
decision as provided in section
