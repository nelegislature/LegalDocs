If by his or her failure to give such notice any property owner permits the allowance of the homestead exemption for any year after the homestead exemption status of such property has changed, an amount equal to the amount of the taxes lawfully due but not paid by reason of such unlawful and improper allowance of homestead exemption, together with penalty and interest on such total sum as provided by statute on delinquent ad valorem taxes, shall be due and shall upon entry of the amount thereof on the books of the county treasurer be a lien on such property while unpaid. Such lien may be enforced in the manner provided for liens for other delinquent taxes. Any person who has permitted the improper and unlawful allowance of such homestead exemption on his or her property shall, as an additional penalty, also forfeit his or her right to a homestead exemption on any property in this state for the two succeeding years.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1979, LB 65, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 494, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 195, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1983, LB 396, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1984, LB 809, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 1985, Second Spec.
