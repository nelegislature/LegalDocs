These sections passed in 1977 as LB 131. The Supreme Court in State ex rel. Douglas v. Herrington, 206 Neb. 516, 294 N.W.2d 330 (1980) held section 77-1350(1) to be unconstitutional and also held such section was not severable and therefor the whole act was unconstitutional.</note></source></law></legaldoc>
