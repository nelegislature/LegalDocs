shall not be available for cigarettes sold in exempt transactions on an Indian

under this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the state's
authority to enter into an agreement pursuant to section 77-2602.06 pertaining
to the collection and dissemination of any cigarette taxes which may otherwise
be inconsistent with this subsection.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2011, LB590, &#167; 22.</para></source>  </law>
