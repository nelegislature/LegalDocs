If a notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date provided in section 77-2777 if no protest is filed or, if a protest is filed, then upon the date when the determination of the Tax Commissioner becomes final. If an amended return or report filed pursuant to the provisions of section 77-2775 concedes the accuracy of a federal change or correction or a state change or correction which has become final on or after May 1, 1993, any deficiency in the income tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended return and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding any other provisions of such act.
