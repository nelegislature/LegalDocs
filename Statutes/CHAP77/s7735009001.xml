The owner shall file the application for transfer with the county assessor on or before August 15 of such year or within thirty days after receiving a notice of rejection on the owner's application for exemption for the original homestead. The county assessor shall examine each application for transfer and determine whether or not the new homestead, except for the January 1 through August 15 ownership and occupancy requirement and the income requirements, is eligible for exemption under section 77-3506, 77-3507, or 77-3508. If the application for transfer is approved by the county assessor, he or she shall make a deduction upon the assessment rolls using the same criteria as previously applied to the original homestead. The county assessor may allow the application for transfer to also be considered an application for a homestead exemption for the subsequent year.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1983, LB 494, &#167; 5; </para><para>Laws 1984, LB 809, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1985, Second Spec.
