defeat the tax or the payment thereof, the Tax Commissioner may, in addition
to other penalties provided by law, impose, assess, and collect a penalty

to be a return but which does not contain sufficient information from which
to determine the correctness of the self-assessment of tax or which contains

incorrect, such person shall pay a penalty of five hundred dollars for each
occurrence. The penalty provided by this subsection shall be in addition to
any other penalties provided by law.</para>
<para>(8) Any person who aids, procures, advises, or assists in

<para>(b) A determination of a material deficiency shall not be
sufficient to show that a person has aided or assisted in a material understatement
of the tax liability of another person.</para>
<para>(c) The penalty in this subsection shall not be imposed more
than once on any person for having aided or assisted in the preparation of
documents for the same taxpayer, the same tax, and the same tax period regardless
of the number of documents involved.</para>
<para>(d) Such penalty shall apply whether or not the understatement
is with the consent of the person authorized to present the return, affidavit,
refund claim, or other document.</para>
<para>(9) The additions to the income tax and penalties relating
thereto provided by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 shall be paid upon notice
and demand and shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as
taxes, and any reference in such act to income tax or the tax imposed by the

with regard to any extension of time for such filing.</para>
<para>(11) For purposes of subsections (5) and (6) of this section,
the term person shall include an individual, corporation, partnership, or

<para>(12) If any person fails to comply with the reporting or
filing requirements of sections 77-2772, 77-2775, and 77-2786 or the rules
and regulations adopted and promulgated thereunder, the Tax Commissioner may
impose, assess, and collect a penalty against such person for each instance
of noncompliance of twenty-five percent of the tax due. Such amount shall
be in addition to any other penalty, tax, or interest otherwise imposed by
law for such noncompliance.</para>
<para>(13) If any nonresident individual provides false information
or statements to an employer or payor regarding the portion of his or her
wages or payments that are subject to withholding for this state which if
used would result in the amount withheld being less than seventy-five percent
of his or her income tax liability on such wages or payments or if any employer
or payor uses such information when the employer or payor knows such information
is false or maintains records which show such information is false, the Tax
Commissioner may, in addition to other penalties provided by law, impose,
assess, and collect from such individual, payor, or employer the penalties
provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section.</para>
<para>(14) If any employer or payor employing twenty-five or more
employees who is required to withhold and pay over income tax imposed by the

from the employee justifying a lower withholding amount as required by subdivision
(1)(b) of section 77-2753, the Tax Commissioner may impose, assess, and collect
a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars per violation.</para>
