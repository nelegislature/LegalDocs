Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.</para><para>(a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.</para><para>(b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a public utility.</para><para>(c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the purchaser, unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation of the Tax Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.</para><para>(d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment, collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on any transaction on an item or an invoice basis. The rounding rule provided in section 77-3,117 applies.</para><para>(e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or enforcing the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 or for any other purpose in connection with such taxes is prohibited.</para><para>(f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail sales tax, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.</para><para>(g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.</para><para>(h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the following conditions:</para><para>(i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax Commissioner;</para><para>(ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the lessor elects to terminate the election;</para><para>(iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the lessor a valid common or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the lessor rents or leases other vehicles for periods of less than one year, such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and</para><para>(iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the determination of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing lease at the time such election becomes effective, the method and manner for terminating such election, and such other rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper administration of this subdivision.</para><para>(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sales of motor vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers as defined in sections 60-339, 60-348, and 60-354 shall be the liability of the purchaser and, with the exception of motor vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers registered pursuant to section 60-3,198, the tax shall be collected by the county treasurer as provided in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act or by an approved licensed dealer participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to section 60-1507 at the time the purchaser makes application for the registration of the motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways of this state.

The sales tax due shall be computed on the difference between the total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in as disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates the amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not register such motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation on the highways of this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles.

In any county with a population of one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants or more, the county treasurer shall remit one dollar of his or her collection fee for each of the first five thousand motor vehicles, semitrailers, or trailers registered with such county treasurer on or after January 1, 2020, to the State Treasurer for credit to the Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund. The Department of Motor Vehicles, for its collection fee, shall deduct, withhold, and deposit in the Motor Carrier Division Cash Fund the collection fee permitted to be deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee for the county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles shall be forfeited if the county treasurer or department violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the collection of the use tax.</para><para>(j)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of a motorboat as defined in section 37-1204 shall be the liability of the purchaser.

The full use tax on the purchase price shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or occupation tax was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a sales or occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate less than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this state.</para><para>(l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules and regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed by this section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable tax is paid in cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject to the taxes imposed by this section and a part of which is not so subject and a separate accounting is not practical or economical.</para><para>(2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from any retailer and on any transaction the gross receipts of which are subject to tax under subsection (1) of this section on or after June 1, 1967, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate set as provided in subsection (1) of this section on the sales price of the property or, in the case of leases or rentals, of the lease or rental prices.</para><para>(a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another person for such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in effect when his or her liability for the use tax becomes certain under the accounting basis used to maintain his or her books and records. His or her liability shall not be extinguished until the use tax has been paid to this state, except that a receipt from a retailer engaged in business in this state or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as he or she may prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers.</para><para>(b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling, leasing, or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in this state shall, at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which may be due from the purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon request, a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.</para><para>(c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper administration of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he or she may deem necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such persons such authority as is necessary to collect any use tax which is due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may require of all persons so designated a surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so collected.
