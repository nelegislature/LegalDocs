Tax credits for each building in a qualified project shall be issued for the first six years of the credit period as defined in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(1), except that any reduction in the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the calculation in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(2) shall be allowable in the seventh year of the credit period.
