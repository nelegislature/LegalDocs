A qualified taxpayer shall be allowed a nonrefundable tax credit if the authority determines that the project for which tax credits are sought is a qualified project.</para><para>(2) If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are met, the authority shall issue an eligibility statement to the owner of such qualified project stating the amount of Nebraska affordable housing tax credits allocated to the qualified project.

Tax credits for each building in a qualified project shall be issued for the first six years of the credit period as defined in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(1), except that any reduction in the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the calculation in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(2) shall be allowable in the seventh year of the credit period.
