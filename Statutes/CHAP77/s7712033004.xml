personal property tax returns; change in value; omitted property; procedure;
penalty; county assessor; duties.</catchline><para>(1) The county assessor
shall list and value at net book value any item of taxable tangible personal
property omitted from a personal property return of any taxpayer. The county
assessor shall change the reported valuation of any item of taxable tangible
personal property listed on the return to conform the valuation to net book
value. If a taxpayer fails or refuses to file a personal property return,
the assessor shall, on behalf of the taxpayer, file a personal property return
which shall list and value all of the taxpayer's taxable tangible personal
property at net book value. The county assessor shall list or change the valuation
of any item of taxable tangible personal property for the current taxing period
and the three previous taxing periods or any taxing period included therein.</para>
<para>(2) The taxable tangible personal property so listed and valued shall
be taxed at the same rate as would have been imposed upon the property in
the tax district in which the property should have been returned for taxation.</para>
<para>(3) Any valuation added to a personal property return or added through
the filing of a personal property return, after May 1 and on or before June 30 of the year the property is required
to be reported, shall be subject to a penalty of ten percent of the tax due
on the value added.</para>
<para>(4) Any valuation added to a personal property return or added through
the filing of a personal property return, on or after July
1 of the year the property is required to be reported, shall be
subject to a penalty of twenty-five percent of the tax due on the value added.</para>
<para>(5) Interest shall be assessed upon both the tax and the penalty at
the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time
be adjusted by the Legislature, from the date the tax would have been delinquent
until paid.</para>
<para>(6) Whenever valuation changes are made to a personal property return
or a personal property return is filed pursuant to this section, the county
assessor shall correct the assessment roll and tax list, if necessary, to
reflect such changes. Such corrections shall be made for the current taxing
period and the three previous taxing periods or any taxing period included
therein. If the change results in a decreased taxable valuation on the personal
property return and the personal property tax has been paid prior to a correction
pursuant to this section, the taxpayer may request a refund of the tax in
the same manner prescribed in section 77-1734.01, except that such request
shall be made within three years after the date the tax was due.</para>
