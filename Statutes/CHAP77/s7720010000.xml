In addition, for failure to file an appropriate proceeding for the determination of the tax within twelve months after the date of the death of the decedent there shall be added to the amount due a penalty of five percent per month or fraction thereof, up to a maximum penalty of twenty-five percent of the unpaid taxes due. The filing of a petition or an application for probate proceedings or the filing of an application under section 77-2018.07 and payment of the tentative tax payment within twelve months of the decedent's death shall be considered an appropriate proceeding for the determination to avoid a penalty and to stop the accrual of a penalty.
