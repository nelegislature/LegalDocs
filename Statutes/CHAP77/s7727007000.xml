Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner's records are made available for audit, whichever period expires the later, the Tax Commissioner shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the Tax Commissioner of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax Commissioner to mail the notice shall release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold a portion of the purchase price as provided in this subsection. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the former owner sells out his business or stock of goods or at the time that the determination against the former owner becomes final, whichever event occurs the later.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1967, c. 487, &#167; 7, p. 1557. </para></source><annotation><para>One found to be a "successor" pursuant to this section would logically be considered the kind of "transferee" denominated "successor" under section 77-27,110.
