<para>The purchaser of any real property sold by the county treasurer
for taxes shall be entitled to a certificate in writing, describing the real
property so purchased, the sum paid, and the time when the purchaser will
be entitled to a deed, which certificate shall be signed by the county treasurer in his or
her official capacity and shall be presumptive evidence of the regularity
of all prior proceedings. Each
tax lien shall be shown on a single certificate. The purchaser
acquires a perpetual lien of the tax on the real property, and if after the
taxes become delinquent he or she subsequently pays any taxes levied on the
property, whether levied for any year or years previous or subsequent to such
sale, he or she shall have the same lien for them and may add them to the
amount paid by him or her in the purchase.</para>
