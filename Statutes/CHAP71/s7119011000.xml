corrective action status; display of license.</catchline><para>(1) A person
may operate child care for three or fewer children without having a license
issued by the department. A person who is not required to be licensed may
choose to apply for a license and, upon obtaining a license, shall be subject
to the Child Care Licensing Act. A person who has had a license issued pursuant
to this section and has had such license suspended or revoked other than for
nonpayment of fees shall not operate or offer to operate a program for or
provide care to any number of children until the person is licensed pursuant
to this section.</para>
<para>(2) No person shall operate or offer to operate a program for four or
more children under his or her direct supervision, care, and control at any
one time from families other than that of such person without having in full
force and effect a written license issued by the department upon such terms
as may be prescribed by the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated
by the department. The license may be a provisional license or an operating
license. A city, village, or county which has rules, regulations, or ordinances
in effect on July 10, 1984, which apply to programs operating for two or three
children from different families may continue to license persons providing
such programs. If the license of a person is suspended or revoked other than
for nonpayment of fees, such person shall not be licensed by any city, village,
or county rules, regulations, or ordinances until the person is licensed pursuant
to this section.</para>
<para>(3) A provisional license shall be issued to all applicants following
the completion of preservice orientation training approved or delivered by
the department for the first year of operation. At the end of one year of
operation, the department shall either issue an operating license, extend
the provisional license, or deny the operating license. The provisional license
may be extended once for a period of no more than six months. The decision
regarding extension of the provisional license is not appealable. The provisional
license may be extended if:</para>
<para>(a) A licensee is unable to comply with all licensure requirements and
standards, is making a good faith effort to comply, and is capable of compliance
within the next six months;</para>
<para>(b) The effect of the current inability to comply with a rule or regulation
does not present an unreasonable risk to the health, safety, or well-being
of children or staff; and</para>
<para>(c) The licensee has a written plan of correction that has been approved
by the department which is to be completed within the renewal period.</para>
<para>(4) The department may place a provisional or operating license on corrective
action status. Corrective action status is voluntary and may be in effect
for up to six months. The decision regarding placement on corrective action
status is not a disciplinary action and is not appealable. If the written
plan of correction is not approved by the department, the department may discipline
the license. A probationary license may be issued for the licensee to operate
under corrective action status if the department determines that:</para>
<para>(a) The licensee is unable to comply with all licensure requirements
and standards or has had a history of noncompliance;</para>
<para>(b) The effect of noncompliance with any rule or regulation does not
present an unreasonable risk to the health, safety, or well-being of children
or staff; and</para>
<para>(c) The licensee has a written plan of correction that has been approved
by the department.</para>
<para>(5) Operating licenses issued under the Child Care Licensing Act shall
remain in full force and effect subject to annual inspections and fees. The
department may amend a license upon change of ownership or location. Amending
a license requires a site inspection by the department at the time of amendment. When a
program is to be permanently closed, the licensee shall return the license
to the department within one week after the closing.</para>
<para>(6) The license, including any applicable status or amendment, shall
be displayed by the licensee in a prominent place so that it is clearly visible
to parents and others. License record information and inspection reports shall
be made available by the licensee for public inspection upon request.</para>
