Any recreational vehicle which bears the seal of any state which has been placed on the reciprocity list shall not be required to bear the seal issued by this state. A manufactured home manufactured more than four months after May 27, 1975, which does not bear the federal manufactured-home label issued by this state or by a state which has been placed on the reciprocity list shall not be permitted to be manufactured, offered for sale, sold, or leased by a manufacturer, dealer, or any other person anywhere within this state nor delivered from this state into any other state or jurisdiction unless destined for sale outside the United States. A recreational vehicle manufactured in this state, which is offered for sale, sold, or leased by a manufacturer, dealer, or other person anywhere outside this state, shall not be required to bear the seal issued by this state. If a recreational vehicle has a certificate of title or other certification from a state on the reciprocity list, a dealer may sell it unless he or she has actual knowledge that the recreational vehicle does not meet the standards of the state which has issued a certificate of title or other certification for it, so long as it bears the seal issued by this state or a state on the reciprocity list. No dealer or distributor shall sell a manufactured home or recreational vehicle if it contains a defect, a serious defect, or an imminent safety hazard.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 557, &#167; 6, p. 2273; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 654, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 300, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 313, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 536, &#167; 89; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1155, &#167; 34; </para><para>Laws 1998, LB 1073, &#167; 131. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
