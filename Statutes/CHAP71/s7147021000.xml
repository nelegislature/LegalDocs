A former member who has served two consecutive terms may be reappointed to the commission after at least one year of nonservice. The terms of the members shall expire on January 31 of the final year of their appointed term. As the terms of the appointees expire, succeeding appointees shall be representatives of the same segment of the public as the previous appointee, and such successors shall be appointed to three-year terms, except appointees to vacancies occurring from unexpired terms, in which case the successor shall serve out the term of his or her predecessor.
