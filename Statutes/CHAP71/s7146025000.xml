The application for such permit shall be made to the department in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations of the department, which shall require the applicant to supply plans and specifications and otherwise provide a description of the nature, type, location and extent of the sanitary facilities contemplated. When the application has been approved, the department shall issue a permit to the applicant to construct, expand, remodel or make alterations to sanitary facilities, including water and sewage disposal, upon a mobile home park and the appurtenances thereto according to the plans and specifications and other data submitted with the approved application. No approval of plans and specifications and issuance of a permit to construct, expand, remodel or make alterations upon a mobile home park and the appurtenances thereto by the department shall be made unless such park is in compliance with the provisions of sections 71-4621 to 71-4634 and the rules, regulations and standards of the department. Such a permit does not relieve the applicant from obtaining building permits when located within a municipality or county having a building code or from complying with any other municipal or county resolution, ordinance, or regulation applicable thereto, and not in conflict with sections 71-4621 to 71-4634.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1976, LB 91, &#167; 5. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
