Applications for Licensure in a Party State</para><para>(a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure privilege, and whether any other adverse action by any state has been taken against the license.</para><para>(b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the home state.</para><para>(c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new home state in advance of such change.

The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.</para><para>(c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state. However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the license issued by the home state.</para><para>(d) For purposes of imposing adverse action, the licensing board of the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</para><para>(e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, so long as each state follows its own procedures for imposing such adverse action.</para><para>(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.
