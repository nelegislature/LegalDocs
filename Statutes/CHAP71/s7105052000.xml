program shall include the monitoring, detection, and investigation of public
health threats from (a) intentional or accidental use or misuse of chemical,
biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, (b) clusters or outbreaks of
infectious or communicable diseases, and (c) noninfectious causes of illness.</para>

surveillance reporting by hospitals. The standards shall specify (a) the syndromic
surveillance data elements required to be reported for all encounters, which
shall include at a minimum the date of the encounter and the patient's gender,
date of birth, chief complaint or reason for encounter, home zip code, unique
record identifier, and discharge diagnoses and (b) the manner of reporting.</para>

health care facilities or any person issued a credential by the department.</para>

establish, by rule and regulation, a schedule for the implementation of full
electronic reporting of all syndromic surveillance data elements. The schedule
shall take into consideration the number of data elements already reported
by the facility or person, the capacity of the facility or person to electronically
report the remaining elements, the funding available for implementation, and
other relevant factors, including improved efficiencies and resulting benefits
to the reporting facility or person.</para><para>(5) The use, confidentiality, and immunity provisions
