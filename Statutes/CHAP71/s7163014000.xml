If a hearing is requested, the applicant or licensee shall be given a hearing before the department and shall have the right to present such evidence as may be proper. On the basis of such evidence, the determination shall be affirmed, modified, or set aside, and a copy of such decision setting forth the findings of fact and the particular reasons upon which such decision was based shall be sent by certified mail to the applicant or licensee. The decision shall become a final decision of the department and may be appealed, and the appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</para><para>(5) Hearings held pursuant to this section shall be held in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department under such act.</para><para>(6) Any civil penalty assessed and unpaid under the Asbestos Control Act shall constitute a debt to the State of Nebraska which may be collected in the manner of a lien foreclosure or sued for and recovered in any proper form of action in the name of the State of Nebraska in the district court of the county in which the violator resides or owns property.
