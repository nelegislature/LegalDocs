The party states find that:</para><para>1. The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;</para><para>2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;</para><para>3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation’s health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</para><para>4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;</para><para>5. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and</para><para>6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.</para><para>b. The general purposes of this Compact are to:</para><para>1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety;</para><para>2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</para><para>3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;</para><para>4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;</para><para>5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;</para><para>6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and</para><para>7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.</para><para>ARTICLE II</para><para>Definitions</para><para>As used in this Compact:</para><para>a. Adverse action means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a state’s laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a nurse, including actions against an individual’s license or multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, limitation on the licensee’s practice, or any other encumbrance on licensure affecting a nurse’s authorization to practice, including issuance of a cease and desist action.</para><para>b. Alternative program means a nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by a licensing board.</para><para>c. Coordinated licensure information system means an integrated process for collecting, storing, and sharing information on nurse licensure and enforcement activities related to nurse licensure laws that is administered by a nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by licensing boards.</para><para>d. Current significant investigative information means:</para><para>1. Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or</para><para>2. Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.</para><para>e. Encumbrance means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.</para><para>f.

A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.</para><para>b. A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement.

The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.</para><para>f. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state’s single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.</para><para>g. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this Compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse’s then-current home state, provided that:</para><para>1. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this Compact’s effective date, must meet all applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new home state.</para><para>2. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III.c. due to a disqualifying event occurring after this Compact’s effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse’s multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators.</para><para>ARTICLE IV</para><para>Applications for Licensure in a Party State</para><para>a. Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.</para><para>b. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.</para><para>c. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators.</para><para>1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.</para><para>2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.</para><para>d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.</para><para>ARTICLE V</para><para>Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards</para><para>a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:</para><para>1. Take adverse action against a nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.</para><para>i. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse’s license issued by the home state.</para><para>ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</para><para>2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse’s authority to practice within that party state.</para><para>3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate actions and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.</para><para>4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.</para><para>5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions.</para><para>6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.</para><para>7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.</para><para>b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse’s multistate license, the nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse’s multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse’s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</para><para>c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse’s participation in an alternative program.</para><para>ARTICLE VI</para><para>Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information</para><para>a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.</para><para>b. The Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this Compact.</para><para>c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials), and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.</para><para>d. Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.</para><para>e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.</para><para>f. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.</para><para>g. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.</para><para>h. The Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:</para><para>1. Identifying information;</para><para>2. Licensure data;</para><para>3. Information related to alternative program participation; and</para><para>4.

Oversight</para><para>1. Each party state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this Compact’s purposes and intent.</para><para>2. The Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.</para><para>b. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination</para><para>1. If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:</para><para>i. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and</para><para>ii. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</para><para>2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state’s membership in this Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</para><para>3.
