license; priority status.</catchline><para>For the purpose of providing
blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities
of blind persons, and stimulating blind persons to greater efforts in striving
to make themselves self-supporting, the commission shall administer and operate
vending facilities programs pursuant to the federal Randolph-Sheppard Act,
as amended, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq. Blind persons licensed by the commission
pursuant to its rules and regulations are authorized to operate vending facilities
in any federally owned building or on any federally owned or controlled property,
in any state-owned building or on any property owned or controlled by the
state, or on any property owned or controlled by any county, city, or municipality
with the approval of the local governing body, when, in the judgment of the
director of the commission, such vending facilities may be properly and satisfactorily
operated by blind persons. With respect to vending facilities in any state-owned
building or on any property owned or controlled by the state, priority shall
be given to blind persons, except that this shall not apply to the Game and
Parks Commission or the University of Nebraska. This priority shall only be
given if the product price
in the bid submitted is comparable in price to the product price in the other
bids submitted for similar
products sold in similar buildings or on similar property and all
other components of the bid for a contract, except for any rent paid to the state, are
found to be reasonably equivalent to the
other bidders.</para>
