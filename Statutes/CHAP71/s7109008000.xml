Lux v. Mental Health Board of Polk County, 202 Neb. 106, 274 N.W.2d 141 (1979).</para><para>Before a person may be committed for treatment by a mental health board, the board must determine that the person meets the definition of a mentally ill and dangerous person as set forth herein.

Appeal</emphasis></para><para>An order adjudicating an individual as a mentally ill dangerous person pursuant to this section and ordering that person retained for an indeterminate amount of time is an order affecting a substantial right in a special proceeding from which an appeal may be taken.
