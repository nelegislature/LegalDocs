The Legislature further finds that, despite the success of prevention efforts, sudden infant death syndrome has been the second leading cause of death for infants in Nebraska for the last twenty years. Although there are no known ways to prevent sudden infant death syndrome in all cases, there are steps that parents and caregivers can take to reduce the risk of sudden infant death. The Legislature further finds and declares that there is a present and growing need to provide additional programs aimed at reducing the number of cases of sudden infant death syndrome in Nebraska.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2006, LB 994, &#167; 147.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
