Any mental health professional conducting such evaluation at the request of the mental health board shall be compensated by the county or counties served by such board at a rate determined by the district judge and reimbursed for mileage at the rate provided in section 81-1176.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2006, LB 1199, &#167; 65.</para></source><annotation><para>Under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the State's burden to prove that "neither voluntary hospitalization nor other treatment alternatives less restrictive of the subject's liberty than inpatient or outpatient treatment ordered by the mental health board are available or would suffice" was not met when the State provided evidence only of the treatment that would be recommended if the subject were to remain within the Department of Correctional Services.
