In other words, an order that merely authorized development of a plan for custody and treatment and scheduled a hearing to determine what custody and treatment should be ordered upon disposition, without imposing any custody or treatment, did not have a substantial effect on a substantial right and thus was not a final, appealable order under section 25-1902.
