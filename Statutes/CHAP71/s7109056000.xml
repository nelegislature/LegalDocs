The mental health board shall make similar written findings when it orders a subject held in custody rather than released on conditions pending hearings to determine whether he or she is mentally ill and dangerous or a dangerous sex offender and in need of treatment ordered by the mental health board or pending the entry of an order of final disposition under section 71-925 or 71-1209.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1976, LB 806, &#167; 70; </para><para>Laws 1981, LB 95, &#167; 24; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1999), &#167; 83-1060; </para><para>Laws 2004, LB 1083, &#167; 76; </para><para>Laws 2006, LB 1199, &#167; 47. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
