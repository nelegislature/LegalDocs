license required; license renewal; kinship homes and relative homes; department
and child-placing agencies; duties; placement in nonlicensed relative home
or kinship home; approval by department; when; license revocation;
procedure.</catchline><para>(1) The department shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
on requirements for licenses, waivers, variances, and approval of foster family
homes taking into consideration the health, safety, well-being, and best interests
of the child. An initial assessment of a foster family home shall be completed
and shall focus on the safety, protection, and immediate health, educational,
developmental, and emotional needs of the child and the willingness and ability
of the foster home, relative home, or kinship home to provide a safe, stable,
and nurturing environment for a child for whom the department or child-placing
agency has assumed responsibility.</para><para>(2)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this
section, no person shall furnish or offer to furnish foster care for one or
more children without having in
full force and effect a written license issued by the department upon such
terms and conditions as may be prescribed by general rules and regulations
adopted and promulgated by the department. The
terms and conditions for licensure may allow foster family homes to meet licensing
standards through variances equivalent to the established standards.</para>
<para>(b) The department may issue
a time-limited, nonrenewable provisional license to an applicant who is unable
to comply with all licensure requirements and standards, is making a good
faith effort to comply, and is capable of compliance within the time period
stated in the license. The department may issue a time-limited, nonrenewable
probationary license to a licensee who agrees to establish compliance with
rules and regulations that, when violated, do not present an unreasonable
risk to the health, safety, or well-being of the foster children in the care
of the applicant.</para>
<para>(3) Kinship
homes and relative homes are exempt from licensure, however, such homes should
make efforts to be licensed if such license will facilitate the permanency
plan of the child. The department and child-placing agencies shall, when requested
or as part of the child's permanency plan, provide resources for and assistance
with licensure, including, but not limited to, information on licensure, waivers
for relative homes, kinship-specific and relative-specific foster care training,
referral to local service providers and support groups, and funding and resources
available to address home safety or other barriers to licensure.</para>
<para>(4) Prior
to placement in a nonlicensed relative home or kinship home, approval shall
be obtained from the department. Requirements for initial approval shall include,
but not be limited to, the initial assessment provided for in subsection (1)
of this section, a home visit to assure adequate and safe housing, and a criminal
background check of all adult residents. Final approval shall include, but
not be limited to, requirements as appropriate under section 71-1903. The
department or child-placing agency shall provide assistance to an approved
relative home or kinship home to support the care, protection, and nurturing
of the child. Support may include, but not be limited to, information on licensure,
waivers, and variances, kinship-specific and relative-specific foster care
training, mental and physical health care, options for funding for needs of
the child, and service providers and support groups to address the needs of
relative and kinship parents, families, and children.</para><para>(5) All nonprovisional and
nonprobationary licenses issued under sections 71-1901 to 71-1906.01 shall
expire two years from the date of issuance and shall be subject to renewal
under the same terms and conditions as the original license, except that if
a licensee submits a completed renewal application thirty days or more before
the license's expiration date, the license shall remain in effect until the
department either renews the license or denies the renewal application. No
license issued pursuant to this section shall be renewed unless the licensee
has completed the required hours of training in foster care in the preceding
twelve months as prescribed by the department. A license may be revoked for cause,
after notice and hearing, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted
and promulgated by the department.</para>
<para>(6) A young adult continuing
to reside in a foster family home as provided in subdivision (2) of section
43-4505 does not constitute an unrelated adult for the purpose of determining
eligibility of the family to be licensed as a foster family home.</para>
