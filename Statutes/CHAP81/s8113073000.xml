of Employee Relations of the Department of Administrative Services shall be
excluded from any bargaining unit of state employees.</para>
<para>(2) Any employee organization, including one which represents
other state employees, may be certified or recognized as provided in the Industrial
Relations Act as the exclusive collective-bargaining agent for a supervisory
unit, except that such unit shall not have full collective-bargaining rights
but shall be afforded only meet-and-confer rights.</para>
<para>(3) It is the intent of the Legislature that professional
and managerial employee classifications and office and service employee classifications
be grouped in broad occupational units for the University of Nebraska and
the Nebraska state colleges established on a university-wide or college-system-wide
basis, including all campuses within the system. Any unit entirely composed
of supervisory employees of the University of Nebraska or the Nebraska state
colleges shall be afforded only meet-and-confer rights. The bargaining units for academic,
faculty, and teaching employees of the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska
state colleges shall continue as they existed on April 9, 1987, plus the addition of Kearney State College, and
any adjustments thereto or new units therefor shall continue to be determined
pursuant to the Industrial Relations Act.</para>
<para>(4) Other
constitutional offices shall continue to subscribe to the procedures for unit
determination in the Industrial Relations Act, except that the commission
is further directed to determine the bargaining units in such manner as to
(a) reduce the effect of overfragmentation of bargaining units on the efficiency
of administration and operations of the constitutional office and (b) be consistent
with the administrative structure of the constitutional office. Any unit entirely
composed of supervisory employees of a constitutional office shall be afforded
only meet-and-confer rights.</para>
