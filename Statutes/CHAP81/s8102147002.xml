sold within this state for sowing purposes shall bear thereon or have attached
thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in
the English language giving the following information, which statement shall
not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to
the container:</para>
<para>(1) For any agricultural seeds or any mixture thereof, any vegetable
seeds or any mixture thereof, or any flower seeds or any mixture thereof for
sowing purposes that have been treated, unless each seed container bears a
label giving the following information and statements as established in the
rules and regulations:</para>
<para>(a) A word or statement indicating that the seeds have been treated;</para>
<para>(b) The commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated
chemical name of any substance used in such treatment;</para>
<para>(c) If the substance used in such treatment in the amount remaining
with the seeds is harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, an appropriate
caution statement approved by the director as adequate for the protection
of the public such as, "Do Not Use For Food Or Feed Or Oil Purposes", except
that the caution statement for mercurials and similarly toxic substances,

a skull and crossbones and a statement such as, "This Seed Has Been Treated
With POISON", in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color;</para>
<para>(d) A description approved by the director for the protection of the
public of any process used in such treatment; and</para>

is required to be named, the word mixture, mix, mixed, or blend shall be shown
conspicuously on the label. Hybrids shall be labeled as hybrids except when
the pure seed contains less than seventy-five percent hybrid seed. If the
percentage of the hybrid seed is equal to or greater than seventy-five percent
but less than ninety-five percent, the percentage of hybrid shall be labeled

be stated if desired. The calendar month and year the test was completed to
determine such percentages or an expiration date for those seeds labeled for
lawn and turf purposes shall also be stated;</para>
<para>(i) For each of the following named grasses the percentage of germination
exclusive of dormant seed, the percentage of dormant seed if present, or the
percentage of viability as indicated by a tetrazolium (TZ) test and the calendar
month and year the test was completed to determine such percentages. Following
the percentage of germination, exclusive of dormant seed and the percentage
of dormant seed, if present, the total germination and dormant seed may be
stated if desired. Also, for each of the following named grasses when extreme
dormancy is encountered, the result of a tetrazolium (TZ) test may be shown
in lieu of the percentage of germination to indicate the potential viability
