have an expectation that newly built houses or buildings they buy meet uniform
energy efficiency standards. Therefor, the Legislature finds that there is
a need to adopt the 2009 International Energy
Conservation Code in order (1) to ensure that a minimum energy efficiency
standard is maintained throughout the state, (2) to harmonize and clarify
energy building code statutory references, (3) to ensure compliance with the
National Energy Policy Act of 1992, (4) to increase energy savings for all
Nebraska consumers, especially low-income Nebraskans, (5) to reduce the cost
of state programs that provide assistance to low-income Nebraskans, (6) to
reduce the amount of money expended to import energy, (7) to reduce the growth
of energy consumption, (8) to lessen the need for new power plants, and (9)
to provide training for local code officials and residential and commercial
builders who implement the 2009 International Energy
Conservation Code.</para>
