arrangement; Governor findings.</catchline><para>(1) If the Governor finds
that two or more adjoining counties would be better served by an interjurisdictional
emergency management arrangement than by maintaining separate emergency management
organizations and services, he or she may delineate by order or regulation
an interjurisdictional area adequate to plan for, prevent, or respond to a
disaster, emergency, or civil defense emergency in that area and direct such
steps to be taken as are necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional
emergency management relationship, a joint emergency operations plan, mutual
aid, or an interjurisdictional emergency management organization. A finding
of the Governor pursuant to this subsection shall be based on one or more
factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective
disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery and
emergency management system without such interjurisdictional arrangement,
such as:</para>
<para>(a) Small or sparse population;</para>
<para>(b) Limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make
maintenance of separate emergency management organizations and services unreasonably
burdensome;</para>
<para>(c) Unusual vulnerability to disaster, emergency, or civil defense emergency
as evidenced by past history, topographical features, drainage characteristics,
potential for disaster, emergency, or civil defense emergency, and presence
of facilities or operations prone to disaster, emergency, or civil defense
emergency;</para>
<para>(d) The interrelated character of the counties in a multicounty area;
or</para>
<para>(e) Other relevant conditions or circumstances.</para>
<para>(2) If the Governor finds that a vulnerable area lies only partly within
this state and includes territory in another state or states and that it would
be desirable to establish an interstate relationship, mutual aid, or an interstate
emergency management organization, he or she shall take steps to that end
as desirable. If this action is taken with jurisdictions that have enacted
the Interstate Civil Defense and Disaster Compact, any resulting agreements
may be considered supplemental agreements pursuant to Article 6 of that compact.</para>
<para>(3) If the other jurisdictions with which the Governor proposes to cooperate
pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have not enacted the compact, he
or she may negotiate special agreements with the jurisdictions. Any agreement,
if sufficient authority for the making thereof does not otherwise exist, shall
become effective only after its text has been communicated electronically to the Legislature and if the
Legislature has not disapproved it prior to adjournment of the next session
competent to consider it or within thirty days of its submission, whichever
is later.</para>
