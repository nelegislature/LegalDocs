such bonds into the Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction
Loan Fund.</para>

clean water to the citizens of the state, promoting the health and well-being
of the citizens, and assisting in the economic growth and development of the
state and its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit and the taxing
power of the state are not pledged to the payment of such bonds or the interest
thereon.</para>
