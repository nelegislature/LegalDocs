Before the commission censures a licensee, imposes a civil fine, revokes or suspends a license, or issues a cease and desist order, the
commission shall send to the licensee or
violator a copy of the complaint by certified mail which contains
the charges against the licensee or
violator and, unless the licensee or violator waives the right to a hearing and
has executed a consent order, give the licensee or violator a hearing on the matter.</para>
<para>(2) The licensee or violator shall
have full authority to be heard in person or by counsel before the commission
in reference to such charges. The commission shall, at least twenty days prior
to the date set for hearing, notify the licensee or violator in writing of the date and place
of the hearing. Such notice may be served by delivering it personally to the licensee or violator or by
sending it by either registered or certified mail to the last-known business
address of such licensee or any known address of the
violator. If the licensee is
an associate broker or a salesperson, the commission shall also notify the
broker employing the licensee by
mailing a copy of such notice to the broker's last-known business address.</para>
