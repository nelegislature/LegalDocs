DROP provides that subsequent to attaining normal age and service retirement eligibility, a member may voluntarily choose to participate in DROP upon its adoption which, for purposes of this section, shall be the earlier of September 1, 2008, or the first of the month following a favorable letter determination by the Internal Revenue Service. If the member chooses to participate in DROP, the member shall be deemed to have retired but shall not be deemed to be terminated, and the member may continue in active employment for up to a five-year period. During the DROP period, the member's retirement benefit payments shall be deposited into the DROP account for the benefit of the member until the member actually retires from active employment at or before the expiration of the DROP period. Thereafter, future retirement benefit payments shall be made directly to the member, and the member shall have access to all funds in the DROP account designated for the benefit of the member. DROP funds shall be held and invested in a defined contribution account under section 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall meet the limitations in section 415 of the code.</para><para>(2) To participate in the DROP program, a member shall meet the following requirements:</para><para>(a) A member shall be eligible to enter DROP at any time subsequent to the date when the member has (i) attained normal retirement age and (ii) completed twenty-five years of service.

On or before the completion of the DROP period, the member must separate from active employment and exit DROP. During the DROP period, a member's retirement benefit shall be payable to the DROP account vendor designated in the member's name. Amounts transferred or paid to a participating member's DROP account shall not constitute annual additions under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code;</para><para>(c) A member electing to enter DROP shall choose an annuity payment option. After the option is chosen, the member shall not be entitled to any retirement benefit changes, for reasons including, but not limited to, wage increases, promotions, and demotions, except that the restriction on retirement benefit changes shall not apply in the event of duty-related death or duty-related disability. The benefit amount shall be fixed as of the date of election and shall be payable as if the employee retired on that date and separated from active employment. Upon the death of a member during the DROP period, monthly benefits shall be provided as a percentage of the amount of the member's annuity as set forth in subsection (3) of section 81-2026 based upon the annuity benefit calculation made at commencement of the DROP period. In addition, the balance of the DROP account, if any, shall be provided to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the member in accordance with subsection (6) of section 81-2026 or, if no beneficiary is provided, to the estate of the member.

The member's DROP account shall consist of accrued retirement benefits and interest on such benefits;</para><para>(g) Any member that is enrolled in DROP shall be responsible for directing the DROP account designated for the benefit of the member by investing the account in any DROP investment options. There shall be no guaranteed rate of investment return on DROP account assets. Any losses, charges, or expenses incurred by the participating DROP member in such member's DROP account by virtue of the investment options selected by the participating DROP member shall not be made up by the retirement system but all of the same shall be borne by the participating DROP member. The retirement system, the state, the board, and the state investment officer shall not be responsible for any investment results under the DROP agreement. Transfers between investment options shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations of DROP. A DROP account shall be established for each participating DROP member. Such DROP account shall be adjusted no less frequently than annually for the member's retirement benefit distributions and net investment earnings and losses;</para><para>(h) If the DROP account is subject to administrative or other fees or charges, such fees or charges shall be charged to the participating DROP member's DROP account;</para><para>(i) Cost-of-living adjustments or payments as provided for in section 81-2027.08 or 81-2027.09 and 81-2027.10 shall not be applied to retirement benefits during the DROP period; and</para><para>(j) Any officer who became a member on or after July 1, 2016, is specifically prohibited from participating in DROP.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2007, LB324, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2011, LB509, &#167; 43; </para><para>Laws 2012, LB916, &#167; 32; </para><para>Laws 2013, LB263, &#167; 34; </para><para>Laws 2016, LB467, &#167; 8. </para></source></law>
