Lack of industrial sites and buildings also affects the ability of communities to maintain and develop stable and growth-prone economies.</para><para>(2) The Legislature finds that Nebraska is at a competitive disadvantage for business development relative to other states in the nation due to a lack of appropriately sized industrial sites and buildings available for business relocations to Nebraska and expansions. The future of investment and jobs in Nebraska will suffer should the state continue to ignore this challenge.</para><para>(3) The Legislature finds that development of a public-private-partnership facility in conjunction with the United States Strategic Command will enhance the economic conditions and create conditions favorable to the industrial readiness of the state.</para><para>(4) To enhance the economic development of the state and to provide for the general prosperity of all of Nebraska's citizens, it is in the public interest to assist in the provision of industrial-ready sites and buildings in all areas of the state.
