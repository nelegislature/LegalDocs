Application for the permit shall be made to the Department of Agriculture on forms prescribed and furnished by the department. Application forms shall be submitted to the department accompanied by an annual registration fee based on the number of pounds of agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed the applicant labeled and sold during the preceding calendar year. Registrations shall be renewed on or before January 1 of each year. If a person fails to renew the registration by January 31 of each year, such person shall also be required to pay a delinquency fee of twenty percent per month of the amount of the fee due, not to exceed one hundred percent of the annual registration fee. The purpose of the additional delinquency fee is to cover the administrative costs associated with collecting fees.
