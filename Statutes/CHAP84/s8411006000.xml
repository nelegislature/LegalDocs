The alternates, or some of them, may be selected from among the officer's deputies, but this need not be done unless, in a particular case, the deputy is entitled by law or charter to succeed to such powers and duties in event of the officer's absence or disability. In no instance shall any person be appointed or serve as alternate who would be ineligible legally to be elected or appointed to, or serve in, the office concerned; <emphasis type="italic">Provided,</emphasis> that no constitutional, statutory, or other legal provision prohibiting any official from holding another office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed shall apply to an alternate or acting officer. After making such appointments the officer shall review them periodically and shall make such revisions and additional appointments from time to time as may be necessary to insure that there are at all times at least three alternates who have qualified as provided in section 84-1108 and are able to act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1959, c. 457, &#167; 6, p. 1518. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
