If, within ten working days of the receipt of such letter, it is not established to his satisfaction that steps to implement the act are being expeditiously taken, and there is no valid reason for failing to do so, such as a failure of an appropriation, the Attorney General shall file an action in the appropriate court to compel implementation.
