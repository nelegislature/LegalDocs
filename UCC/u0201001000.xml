<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para>This article is a complete revision and modernization of the Uniform
Sales Act which was promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners
on Uniform State Laws in 1906 and has been adopted in 36 states and the District
of Columbia.</para>
<para>The coverage of the present article is much more extensive than that
of the old Sales Act and extends to the various bodies of case law which have
been developed both outside of and under the latter.</para>
<para>The arrangement of the present article is in terms of contract for sale
and the various steps of its performance. The legal consequences are stated
as following directly from the contract and action taken under
it without resorting to the idea of when property or title passed or was to
pass as being the determining factor. The purpose is to avoid making practical
issues between practical persons turn upon the location of an intangible something,
the passing of which no person can prove by evidence and to substitute for
such abstractions proof of words and actions of a tangible character.</para>
