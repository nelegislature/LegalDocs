A security procedure may impose an obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words, numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by itself a security procedure.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1991, LB 160, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2024, LB94, &#167; 26. </para><effectivedate>July 19, 2024</effectivedate></source></law>
