<catchline>Definitions.</catchline>
<para>(a) In this article:</para>
<para>(1) "Acceptor" means a drawee who has accepted a draft.</para>
<para>(2) "Drawee" means a person ordered in a draft to make payment.</para>
<para>(3) "Drawer" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as
a person ordering payment.</para>
<para>(4) "Good faith" means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable
commercial standards of fair dealing.</para>
<para>(5) "Maker" means a person who signs or is identified in a note as a
person undertaking to pay.</para>
<para>(6) "Order" means a written instruction to pay money signed by the person
giving the instruction. The instruction may be addressed to any person, including
the person giving the instruction, or to one or more persons jointly or in
the alternative but not in succession. An authorization to pay is not an order
unless the person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay.</para>
<para>(7) "Ordinary care" in the case of a person engaged in business means
observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which
the person is located, with respect to the business in which the person is
engaged. In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for
collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards
do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine
does not violate the bank's prescribed procedures and the bank's procedures
do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this
article or article 4.</para>
<para>(8) "Party" means a party to an instrument.</para>
<para>(9) "Promise" means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the
person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor
is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation.</para>
<para>(10) "Prove" with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing
the fact (section 1-201(b)(8)).</para>
<para>(11) "Remitter" means a person who purchases an instrument from its
issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the
purchaser.</para>

<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para>1. Subsection (a) defines some common terms used throughout the article
that were not defined by former article 3 and adds the definitions of "order"
and "promise" found in former section 3-102(1)(b) and (c).</para>
<para>2. The definition of "order" includes an instruction given by the signer
to itself. The most common example of this kind of order is a cashier's check:
A draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches
of the same bank. Former section 3-118(a) treated a cashier's check as a note.
It stated "a draft drawn on the drawer is effective as a note". Although it
is technically more correct to treat a cashier's check as a promise by the
issuing bank to pay rather than an order to pay, a cashier's check is in the
form of a check and it is normally referred to as a check. Thus, revised article
3 follows banking practice in referring to a cashier's check as both a draft
and a check rather than a note. Some insurance companies also follow the practice
of issuing drafts in which the drawer draws on itself and makes the draft
payable at or through a bank. These instruments are also treated as drafts.
The obligation of the drawer of a cashier's check or other draft drawn on
the drawer is stated in section 3-412.</para>
<para>An order may be addressed to more than one person as drawee either jointly
or in the alternative. The authorization of alternative drawees follows former
section 3-102(1)(b) and recognizes the practice of drawers, such as corporations
issuing dividend checks, who for commercial convenience name a number of drawees,
usually in different parts of the country. Section 3-501(b)(1) provides that
presentment may be made to any one of multiple drawees. Drawees in succession
are not permitted because the holder should not be required to make more than
one presentment. Dishonor by any drawee named in the draft entitles the holder
to rights of recourse against the drawer or indorsers.</para>
<para>3. The last sentence of subsection (a)(9) is intended to make it clear
that an I.O.U. or other written acknowledgment of indebtedness is not a note
unless there is also an undertaking to pay the obligation.</para>
<para>4. Subsection (a)(7) is a definition of ordinary care which is applicable
not only to article 3 but to article 4 as well. See section 4-104(c). The
general rule is stated in the first sentence of subsection (a)(7) and it applies
both to banks and to persons engaged in businesses other than banking. Ordinary
care means observance of reasonable commercial standards of the relevant business
prevailing in the area in which the person is located. The second sentence
of subsection (a)(7) is a particular rule limited to the duty of a bank to
examine an instrument taken by a bank for processing for collection or payment
by automated means. This particular rule applies primarily to section 4-406
and it is discussed in comment 4 to that section. Nothing in section 3-103(a)(7)
is intended to prevent a customer from proving that the procedures followed
by a bank are unreasonable, arbitrary, or unfair.</para>
<para>5. In subsection (c) reference is made to a new definition of "bank"
in amended article 4.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
