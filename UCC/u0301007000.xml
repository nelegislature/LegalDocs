<para>The definition of instrument in section 3-104 requires that the promise or order be payable in "money". That term is defined in section 1-201(24) and is not limited to United States dollars. Section 3-107 states that an instrument payable in foreign money may be paid in dollars if the instrument does not prohibit it. It also states a conversion rate which applies in the absence of a different conversion rate stated in the instrument. The reference in former section 3-107(1) to instruments payable in "currency" or "current funds" has been dropped as superfluous.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
