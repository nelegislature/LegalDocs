<para>1. Subsection (1) states a general rule of priority that a creditor of the lessee takes subject to the lease contract. The term lessee (section 2A-103(1)(n)) includes sublessee. Therefor, this subsection not only covers disputes between the prime lessor and a creditor of the prime lessee but also disputes between the prime lessor, or the sublessor, and a creditor of the sublessee. Section 2A-301 official comment 3(g). Further, by using the term creditor (section 1-201(12)), this subsection will cover disputes with a general creditor, a secured creditor, a lien creditor, and any representative of creditors. Section 2A-103(4).</para>
<para>2. Subsection (2) states a general rule of priority that a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract. Note the discussion above with regard to the scope of these rules. Section 2A-301 official comment 3(g). Thus, the section will not only cover disputes between the prime lessee and a creditor of the prime lessor but also disputes between the prime lessee, or the sublessee, and a creditor of the sublessor.</para>
<para>3. To take priority over the lease contract, and the interests derived therefrom, the creditor must come within the exception stated in subsection (2) or within one of the provisions of article 9 mentioned in subsection (3). Subsection (2) provides that where the creditor holds a lien (section 2A-103(1)(r)) that attached before the lease contract became enforceable (section 2A-301), the creditor does not take subject to the lease. Subsection (3) provides that a lessee takes its leasehold interest subject to a security interest except as otherwise provided in section 9-317, 9-321, or 9-323.</para>
<para>4. The rules of this section operate in favor of whichever party to the lease contract may enforce it, even if one party perhaps may not, e.g., under section 2A-201(1)(b).</para>
