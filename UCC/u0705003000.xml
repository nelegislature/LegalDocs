<para>(2) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.</para>
<para>(b) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. That title may be defeated under section 7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.</para>
<para>(c) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated.
