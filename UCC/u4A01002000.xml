<para>Article 4A governs a specialized method of payment referred to in the article as a funds transfer but also commonly referred to in the commercial community as a wholesale wire transfer. A funds transfer is made by means of one or more payment orders. The scope of article 4A is determined by the definitions of "payment order" and "funds transfer" found in section 4A-103 and section 4A-104.</para>
<para>The funds transfer governed by article 4A is in large part a product of recent and developing technological changes. Before this article was drafted there was no comprehensive body of law &#8212; statutory or judicial &#8212; that defined the juridical nature of a funds transfer or the rights and obligations flowing from payment orders. Judicial authority with respect to funds transfers is sparse, undeveloped, and not uniform. Judges have had to resolve disputes by referring to general principles of common law or equity, or they have sought guidance in statutes such as article 4 which are applicable to other payment methods. But attempts to define rights and obligations in funds transfers by general principles or by analogy to rights and obligations in negotiable instrument law or the law of check collection have not been satisfactory.</para>
<para>In the drafting of article 4A, a deliberate decision was made to write on a clean slate and to treat a funds transfer as a unique method of payment to be governed by unique rules that address the particular issues raised by this method of payment. A deliberate decision was also made to use precise and detailed rules to assign responsibility, define behavioral norms, allocate risks, and establish limits on liability, rather than to rely on broadly stated, flexible principles. In the drafting of these rules, a critical consideration was that the various parties to funds transfers need to be able to predict risk with certainty, to insure against risk, to adjust operational and security procedures, and to price funds-transfer services appropriately. This consideration is particularly important given the very large amounts of money that are involved in funds transfers.</para>
<para>Funds transfers involve competing interests &#8212; those of the banks that provide funds-transfer services and the commercial and financial organizations that use the services, as well as the public interest. These competing interests were represented in the drafting process and they were thoroughly considered. The rules that emerged represent a careful and delicate balancing of those interests and are intended to be the exclusive means of determining the rights, duties, and liabilities of the affected parties in any situation covered by particular provisions of the article. Consequently, resort to principles of law or equity outside of article 4A is not appropriate to create rights, duties, and liabilities inconsistent with those stated in this article.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
