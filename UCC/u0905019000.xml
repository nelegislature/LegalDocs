<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>1. Source.</emphasis> Former sections 9-403(4) and (7), and section 9-405(2).</para>
<para><emphasis>2. Filing Office's Duties.</emphasis> Subsections (a) through (e) set forth the duties of the filing office with respect to filed records. Subsection (h), which is new, imposes a minimum standard of performance for those duties. Prompt indexing is crucial to the effectiveness of any filing system. An accepted but unindexed record affords no public notice. Subsection (f) requires the filing office to maintain appropriate storage and retrieval facilities, and subsection (g) contains minimum requirements for the retention of records.</para>
<para><emphasis>3. File Number.</emphasis> Subsection (a)(1) requires the filing office to assign a unique number to each filed record. That number is the "file number" only if the record is an initial financing statement. See section 9-102.</para>
<para><emphasis>4. Time of Filing.</emphasis> Subsection (a)(2) and section 9-523 refer to the "date and time" of filing. The statutory text does not contain any instructions to a filing office as to how the time of filing is to be determined. The method of determining or assigning a time of filing is an appropriate matter for filing-office rules to address.</para>
<para><emphasis>5. Related Records.</emphasis> Subsections (c) and (f) are designed to ensure that an initial financing statement and all filed records relating to it are associated with one another, indexed under the name of the debtor, and retrieved together. To comply with subsection (f), a filing office (other than a real property recording office in a state that enacts subsection (f), Alternative B) must be capable of retrieving records in each of two ways: By the name of the debtor and by the file number of the initial financing statement to which the record relates.</para>
<para><emphasis>6. Prohibition on Deleting Names from Index.</emphasis> This article contemplates that the filing office will not delete the name of a debtor from the index until at least one year passes after the effectiveness of the financing statement lapses as to all secured parties of record. See subsection (g). This rule applies even if the filing office accepts an amendment purporting to delete or modify the name of a debtor or terminate the effectiveness of the financing statement. If an amendment provides a modified name for a debtor, the amended name should be added to the index, see subsection (c)(2), but the preamendment name should remain in the index.</para>
<para>Compared to former article 9, the rule in subsection (g) increases the amount of information available to those who search the public records. The rule also contemplates that searchers &#8212; not the filing office &#8212; will determine the significance and effectiveness of filed records.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
