<para><emphasis>2. Effectiveness of Mis-Indexed Records.</emphasis> This section provides that the filing office's error in mis-indexing a record does not render ineffective an otherwise effective record. As did former section 9-401, this section imposes the risk of filing-office error on those who search the files rather than on those who file.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
