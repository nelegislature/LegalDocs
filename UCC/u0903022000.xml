<catchline>Priorities among conflicting security interests in and agricultural liens on same collateral.</catchline>
<para>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules:</para>
<para>(1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.</para>
<para>(2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.</para>
<para>(3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.</para>
<para>(b) For the purposes of subdivision (a)(1):</para>
<para>(1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and</para>
<para>(2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.</para>
<para>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under section 9-327, 9-328, 9-329, 9-330, or 9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in:</para>
<para>(1) any supporting obligation for the collateral; and</para>
<para>(2) proceeds of the collateral if:</para>
<para>(A) the security interest in proceeds is perfected;</para>
<para>(B) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and</para>
<para>(C) in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.</para>
<para>(d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.</para>
<para>(e) Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.</para>
<para>(f) Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:</para>
<para>(1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;</para>
<para>(2) section 4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank;</para>
<para>(3) section 5-118 with respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person; and</para>
<para>(4) section 9-110 with respect to a security interest arising under article 2 or 2A.</para>
<para>(g) A perfected agricultural lien on collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in or agricultural lien on the same collateral if the statute creating the agricultural lien so provides.</para>
