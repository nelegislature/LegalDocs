<para>Under former section 3-603, where a liquidated claim held by one party and an unliquidated claim held by a competing party are set off against one another, and the claims arose from the same transaction, interest on the unliquidated claim may be allowed only on any balance due after the setoff.

<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para>This section replaces former section 3-603(1). The phrase "claim to the instrument" in subsection (a) means, by reference to section 3-306, a claim of ownership or possession and not a claim in recoupment. Subsection (b)(1)(ii) is added to conform to section 3-411. Section 3-411 is intended to discourage an obligated bank from refusing payment of a cashier's check, certified check, or dishonored teller's check at the request of a claimant to the check who provided the bank with indemnity against loss. See comment 1 to section 3-411. An obligated bank that refuses payment under those circumstances not only remains liable on the check but may also be liable to the holder of the check for consequential damages. Section 3-602(b)(1)(ii) and section 3-411, read together, change the rule of former section 3-603(1) with respect to the obligation of the obligated bank on the check. Payment to the holder of a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check discharges the obligation of the obligated bank on the check to both the holder and the claimant even though indemnity has been given by the person asserting the claim. If the obligated bank pays the check in violation of an agreement with the claimant in connection with the indemnity agreement, any liability that the bank may have for violation of the agreement is not governed by article 3, but is left to other law. This section continues the rule that the obligor is not discharged on the instrument if payment is made in violation of an injunction against payment. See section 3-411(c)(iv).</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
