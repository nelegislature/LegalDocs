<para>(a) A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction
designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest
of:</para>
<para>(1) the time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location
to another jurisdiction; or</para>
<para>(3) the expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person
that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(b) If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event
described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security
interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction
before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never
to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</para>
<para>(c) A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered
by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods,
remains continuously perfected if:</para>
<para>(1) the collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security
interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;</para>
<para>(2) thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction;
and</para>
<para>(3) upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is
perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest
in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method
under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate
of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would
have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods
not become so covered.</para>
<para>(e) A security interest described in subsection (d) becomes unperfected
as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have
been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable
requirements for perfection under section 9-311(b) or 9-313 are not satisfied
before the earlier of:</para>
<para>(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under
the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate
of title from this state; or</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.</para>
<para>(f) A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights,
or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction,
the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities
intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction,
as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:</para>
<para>(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under
the law of that jurisdiction; or</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction
to another jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(g) If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or
the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.
If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it
becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against
a purchaser of the collateral for value.</para>
<para>(h) The following rules
apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four months
after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:</para>
<para>(1) A financing statement
filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated
in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest
in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to
perfect a security interest in the collateral had the debtor not changed its
location.</para><para>(2)
If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective
under subdivision (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction
before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective
under the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c)
or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter.
If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and
is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral
for value.</para><para>(i)
If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the
law of the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) and the
new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:</para>
<para>(1) The financing statement
is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the
new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound
under section 9-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective
to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired
by the original debtor.</para><para>(2)
A security interest perfected by the financing statement and which becomes
perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the
time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of
the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) or the expiration
of the four-month period remains perfected thereafter. A security interest
that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected
