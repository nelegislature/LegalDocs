<statuteno>9-316</statuteno><catchline>Effect of change in governing law.</catchline>
<para>(a) A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction
designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest
of:</para>
<para>(1) the time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location
to another jurisdiction; or</para>
<para>(3) the expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person
that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(b) If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event
described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security
interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction
before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never
to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</para>
<para>(c) A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered
by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods,
remains continuously perfected if:</para>
<para>(1) the collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security
interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;</para>
<para>(2) thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction;
and</para>
<para>(3) upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is
perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest
in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method
under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate
of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would
have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods
not become so covered.</para>
<para>(e) A security interest described in subsection (d) becomes unperfected
as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have
been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable
requirements for perfection under section 9-311(b) or 9-313 are not satisfied
before the earlier of:</para>
<para>(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under
the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate
of title from this state; or</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.</para>
<para>(f) A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights,
or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction,
the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities
intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction,
as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:</para>
<para>(1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under
the law of that jurisdiction; or</para>
<para>(2) the expiration of four months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction
to another jurisdiction.</para>
<para>(g) If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or
the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.
If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it
becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against
a purchaser of the collateral for value.</para>
<para>(h) The following rules
apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four months
after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:</para>
<para>(1) A financing statement
filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated
in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest
in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to
perfect a security interest in the collateral had the debtor not changed its
location.</para><para>(2)
If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective
under subdivision (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction
before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective
under the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c)
or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter.
If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and
is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral
for value.</para><para>(i)
If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the
law of the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) and the
new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:</para>
<para>(1) The financing statement
is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the
new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound
under section 9-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective
to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired
by the original debtor.</para><para>(2)
A security interest perfected by the financing statement and which becomes
perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the
time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of
the jurisdiction designated in section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) or the expiration
of the four-month period remains perfected thereafter. A security interest
that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes
unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser
of the collateral for value.</para></amendatorysection></section><source>

<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>1. Source.</emphasis> Former section 9-103(1)(d), (2)(b), and (3)(e), as modified.</para>
<para><emphasis>2. Continued Perfection.</emphasis> Subsections (a) through (g) deal with continued perfection of security interests that have been perfected under the law of another jurisdiction. The fact that the law of a particular jurisdiction ceases to govern perfection under sections 9-301 through 9-307 does not necessarily mean that a security interest perfected under that law automatically becomes unperfected. To the contrary: This section generally provides that a security interest perfected under the law of one jurisdiction remains perfected for a fixed period of time (four months or one year, depending on the circumstances), even though the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection changes. However, cessation of perfection under the law of the original jurisdiction cuts short the fixed period. The four-month and one-year periods are long enough for a secured party to discover in most cases that the law of a different jurisdiction governs perfection and to reperfect (typically by filing) under the law of that jurisdiction. If a secured party properly reperfects a security interest before it becomes unperfected under subsection (a), then the security interest remains perfected continuously thereafter. See subsection (b).</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 1:</emphasis> Debtor is a general partnership whose chief executive office is in Pennsylvania. Lender perfects a security interest in Debtor's equipment by filing in Pennsylvania on May 15, 2002. On April 1, 2005, without Lender's knowledge, Debtor moves its chief executive office to New Jersey. Lender's security interest remains perfected for four months after the move. See subsection (a)(2).</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 2:</emphasis> Debtor is a general partnership whose chief executive office is in Pennsylvania. Lender perfects a security interest in Debtor's equipment by filing in Pennsylvania on May 15, 2002. On April 1, 2007, without Lender's knowledge, Debtor moves its chief executive office to New Jersey. Lender's security interest remains perfected only through May 14, 2007, when the effectiveness of the filed financing statement lapses. See subsection (a)(1). Although, under these facts, Lender would have only a short period of time to discover that Debtor had relocated and to reperfect under New Jersey law, Lender could have protected itself by filing a continuation statement in Pennsylvania before Debtor relocated. By doing so, Lender would have prevented lapse and allowed itself the full four months to discover Debtor's new location and refile there or, if Debtor is in default, to perfect by taking possession of the equipment.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 3:</emphasis> Under the facts of example 2, Lender files a financing statement in New Jersey before the effectiveness of the Pennsylvania financing statement lapses. Under subsection (b), Lender's security interest is continuously perfected beyond May 14, 2007, for a period determined by New Jersey's article 9.</para>
<para>Subsection (a)(3) allows a one-year period in which to reperfect. The longer period is necessary, because, even with the exercise of due diligence, the secured party may be unable to discover that the collateral has been transferred to a person located in another jurisdiction. In any event, the period is cut short if the financing statement becomes ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 4:</emphasis> Debtor is a Pennsylvania corporation. On January 1, Lender perfects a security interest in Debtor's equipment by filing in Pennsylvania. Debtor's shareholders decide to "reincorporate" in Delaware. On March 1, they form a Delaware corporation (Newcorp) into which they merge Debtor. The merger effectuates a transfer of the collateral from Debtor to Newcorp, which thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction. Under subsection (a)(3), the security interest remains perfected for one year after the merger. If a financing statement is filed in Delaware against Newcorp within the year following the merger, then the security interest remains perfected thereafter for a period determined by Delaware's article 9.</para>
<para>Note that although Newcorp is a "new debtor" as defined in section 9-102, the application of subsection (a)(3) is not limited to transferees who are new debtors. Note also that, under section 9-507, the financing statement naming Debtor remains effective even though Newcorp has become the debtor.</para>
<para>Subsection (a) addresses security interests that are perfected (i.e., that have attached and as to which any required perfection step has been taken) before the debtor changes its location. Subsection (h) applies to security interests that have not attached before the location changes. See comment 7.</para>
<para><emphasis>3. Retroactive Unperfection.</emphasis> Subsection (b) sets forth the consequences of the failure to reperfect before perfection ceases under subsection (a): The security interest becomes unperfected prospectively and, as against purchasers for value, including buyers and secured parties, but not as against donees or lien creditors, retroactively. The rule applies to agricultural liens, as well. See also section 9-515 (taking the same approach with respect to lapse). Although this approach creates the potential for circular priorities, the alternative &#8212; retroactive unperfection against lien creditors &#8212; would create substantial and unjustifiable preference risks.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 5:</emphasis> Under the facts of example 4, six months after the merger, Buyer bought from Newcorp some equipment formerly owned by Debtor. At the time of the purchase, Buyer took subject to Lender's perfected security interest, of which Buyer was unaware. See section 9-315(a)(1)(A). However, subsection (b) provides that if Lender fails to reperfect in Delaware within a year after the merger, its security interest becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected against Buyer. Having given value and received delivery of the equipment without knowledge of the security interest and before it was perfected, Buyer would take free of the security interest. See section 9-317(b).</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 6:</emphasis> Under the facts of example 4, one month before the merger, Debtor created a security interest in certain equipment in favor of Financer, who perfected by filing in Pennsylvania. At that time, Financer's security interest is subordinate to Lender's. See section 9-322(a)(1). Financer reperfects by filing in Delaware within a year after the merger, but Lender fails to do so. Under subsection (b), Lender's security interest is deemed never to have been perfected against Financer, a purchaser for value. Consequently, under section 9-322(a)(2), Financer's security interest is now senior.</para>
<para>Of course, the expiration of the time period specified in subsection (a) does not of itself prevent the secured party from later reperfecting under the law of the new jurisdiction. If the secured party does so, however, there will be a gap in perfection, and the secured party may lose priority as a result. Thus, in example 7, if Lender perfects by filing in Delaware more than one year under the merger, it will have a new date of filing and perfection for purposes of section 9-322(a)(1). Financer's security interest, whose perfection dates back to the filing in Pennsylvania under subsection (b), will remain senior.</para>
<para><emphasis>4. Possessory Security Interests.</emphasis> Subsection (c) deals with continued perfection of possessory security interests. It applies not only to security interests perfected solely by the secured party's having taken possession of the collateral. It also applies to security interests perfected by a method that includes as an element of perfection the secured party's having taken possession, such as perfection by taking delivery of a certificated security in registered form, see section 9-313(a), and perfection by obtaining control over a certificated security. See section 9-314(a).</para>
<para><emphasis>5. Goods Covered by Certificate of Title.</emphasis> Subsections (d) and (e) address continued perfection of a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title. The following examples explain the operation of those subsections.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 7:</emphasis> Debtor's automobile is covered by a certificate of title issued by Illinois. Lender perfects a security interest in the automobile by complying with Illinois' certificate-of-title statute. Thereafter, Debtor applies for a certificate of title in Indiana. Six months thereafter, Creditor acquires a judicial lien on the automobile. Under section 9-303(b), Illinois law ceases to govern perfection; rather, once Debtor delivers the application and applicable fee to the appropriate Indiana authority, Indiana law governs. Nevertheless, under Indiana's section 9-316(d), Lender's security interest remains perfected until it would become unperfected under Illinois law had no certificate of title been issued by Indiana. (For example, Illinois' certificate-of-title statute may provide that the surrender of an Illinois certificate of title in connection with the issuance of a certificate of title by another jurisdiction causes a security interest noted thereon to become unperfected.) If Lender's security interest remains perfected, it is senior to Creditor's judicial lien.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 8:</emphasis> Under the facts in example 7, five months after Debtor applies for an Indiana certificate of title, Debtor sells the automobile to Buyer. Under subsection (e)(2), because Lender did not reperfect within the four months after the goods became covered by the Indiana certificate of title, Lender's security interest is deemed never to have been perfected against Buyer. Under section 9-317(b), Buyer is likely to take free of the security interest. Lender could have protected itself by perfecting its security interest either under Indiana's certificate-of-title statute, see section 9-311, or, if it had a right to do so under an agreement or section 9-609, by taking possession of the automobile. See section 9-313(b).</para>
<para>The results in examples 7 and 8 do not depend on the fact that the original perfection was achieved by notation on a certificate of title. Subsection (d) applies regardless of the method by which a security interest is perfected under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods became covered by a certificate of title from this state.</para>
<para>Section 9-337 affords protection to a limited class of persons buying or acquiring a security interest in the goods while a security interest is perfected under the law of another jurisdiction but after this state has issued a clean certificate of title.</para>
<para><emphasis>6. Deposit Accounts, Letter-of-Credit Rights, and Investment Property.</emphasis> Subsections (f) and (g) address changes in the jurisdiction of a bank, issuer of an uncertificated security, issuer of or nominated person under a letter of credit, securities intermediary, and commodity intermediary. The provisions are analogous to those of subsections (a) and (b).</para>
<para><emphasis>7. Security Interests that Attach after Debtor Changes Location.</emphasis> In contrast to subsections (a) and (b), which address security interests that are perfected (i.e., that have attached and as to which any required perfection step has been taken) before the debtor changes its location, subsection (h) addresses security interests that attach within four months after the debtor changes its location. Under subsection (h), a filed financing statement that would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the debtor had not changed its location is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired within four months after the relocation.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 9:</emphasis> Debtor, an individual whose principal residence is in Pennsylvania, grants to Lender a security interest in Debtor's existing and after-acquired inventory. Lender perfects the security interest by filing a proper financing statement in Pennsylvania on January 2, 2014. On March 31, 2014, Debtor's principal residence is relocated to New Jersey. Upon the relocation, New Jersey law governs perfection of a security interest in Debtor's inventory. See sections 9-301, 9-307. Under New Jersey's section 9-316(a), Lender's security interest in Debtor's inventory on hand at the time of the relocation remains perfected for four months thereafter. Had Debtor not relocated, the financing statement filed in Pennsylvania would have been effective to perfect Lender's security interest in inventory acquired by Debtor after March 31, 2014. Accordingly, under subsection (h), the financing statement is effective to perfect Lender's security interest in inventory that Debtor acquires within the four months after Debtor's location changed.</para>
<para>In example 9, Lender's security interest in the inventory acquired within the four months after Debtor's relocation will be perfected when it attaches. It will remain perfected if, before the expiration of the four-month period, the security interest is perfected under the law of New Jersey. Otherwise, the security interest will become unperfected at the end of the four-month period and will be deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value. See subsection (h)(2). </para>
<para><emphasis>8. Collateral Acquired by New Debtor.</emphasis> Subsection (i) is similar to subsection (h). Whereas subsection (h) addresses security interests that attach within four months after a debtor changes its location, subsection (i) addresses security interests that attach within four months after a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person. Subsection (i) also addresses collateral acquired by the new debtor before it becomes bound.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 10:</emphasis> Debtor, a Pennsylvania corporation, grants to Lender a security interest in Debtor's existing and after-acquired inventory. Lender perfects the security interest by filing a proper financing statement in Pennsylvania on January 2, 2014. On March 31, 2014, Debtor merges into Survivor, a Delaware corporation. Because Survivor is located in Delaware, Delaware law governs perfection of a security interest in Survivor's inventory. See sections 9-301, 9-307. Under Delaware's section 9-316(a), Lender's security interest in the inventory that Survivor acquired from Debtor remains perfected for one year after the transfer. See comment 2. By virtue of the merger, Survivor becomes bound as debtor by Debtor's security agreement. See section 9-203(d). As a consequence, Lender's security interest attaches to all of Survivor's inventory under section 9-203, and Lender's collateral now includes inventory in which Debtor never had an interest. The financing statement filed in Pennsylvania against Debtor is effective under Delaware's section 9-316(i) to perfect Lender's security interest in inventory that Survivor acquired before, and within the four months after, becoming bound as debtor by Debtor's security agreement. This is because the financing statement filed in Pennsylvania would have been effective to perfect Lender's security interest in this collateral had Debtor, rather an Survivor, acquired it.</para>
<para>If the financing statement is effective, Lender's security interest in the collateral that Survivor acquired before, and within four months after, Survivor became bound as debtor will be perfected upon attachment. It will remain perfected if, before the expiration of the four-month period, the security interest is perfected under Delaware law. Otherwise, the security interest will become unperfected at the end of the four-month period and will be deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value.</para>
<para>Section 9-325 contains special rules governing the priority of competing security interests in collateral that is transferred, by merger or otherwise, to a new debtor or other person who becomes a debtor with respect to the collateral. Section 9-326 contains special rules governing the priority of competing security interests in collateral acquired by a new debtor other than by transfer from the original debtor.</para>
<para><emphasis>9. Agricultural Liens.</emphasis> This section does not apply to agricultural liens.</para>
<para><emphasis>Example 11:</emphasis> Supplier holds an agricultural lien on corn. The lien arises under an Iowa statute. Supplier perfects by filing a financing statement in Iowa, where the corn is located. See section 9-302. Debtor stores the corn in Missouri. Assume the Iowa agricultural lien survives or an agricultural lien arises under Missouri law (matters that this article does not govern). Once the corn is located in Missouri, Missouri becomes the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection. See section 9-302. Thus, the agricultural lien will not be perfected unless Supplier files a financing statement in Missouri.</para></annotation>  </law>
