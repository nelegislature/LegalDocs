<para>What is a reasonable amount of time to reject goods is a question of fact and is dependent upon the circumstances surrounding the action. Smith v. Paoli Popcorn Co., 255 Neb. 910, 587 N.W.2d 660 (1999).</para>
<para>A buyer who elects to exercise his right to revoke acceptance has a duty not to exercise ownership over the goods. Wendt v. Beardmore Suburban Chevrolet, 219 Neb. 775, 366 N.W.2d 424 (1985).</para>
<para>Under this section of the Code, rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. The rejection is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller. Fabricators, Inc. v. Farmers Elevator, Inc., 203 Neb. 150, 277 N.W.2d 676 (1979).</para>
<para>A buyer's decision to reject property purchased because of its failure to conform to contract must be made with entire good faith, and not captiously or capriciously. Maas v. Scoboda, 188 Neb. 189, 195 N.W.2d 491 (1972).</para>

<para>To make it clear that:</para>
<para>1. A tender or delivery of goods made pursuant to a contract of sale, even though wholly nonconforming, requires affirmative action by the buyer to avoid acceptance. Under subsection (1), therefor, the buyer is given a reasonable time to notify the seller of his or her rejection, but without such seasonable notification his or her rejection is ineffective. The sections of this article dealing with inspection of goods must be read in connection with the buyer's reasonable time for action under this subsection. Contract provisions limiting the time for rejection fall within the rule of the section on "time" and are effective if the time set gives the buyer a reasonable time for discovery of defects. What constitutes a due "notifying" of rejection by the buyer to the seller is defined in section 1-201.</para>
<para>2. Subsection (2) lays down the normal duties of the buyer upon rejection, which flow from the relationship of the parties. Beyond his or her duty to hold the goods with reasonable care for the buyer's disposition, this section continues the policy of prior uniform legislation in generally relieving the buyer from any duties with respect to them, except when the circumstances impose the limited obligation of salvage upon him or her under the next section.</para>
<para>3. The present section applies only to rightful rejection by the buyer. If the seller has made a tender which in all respects conforms to the contract, the buyer has a positive duty to accept and his or her failure to do so constitutes a "wrongful rejection" which gives the seller immediate remedies for breach. Subsection (3) is included here to emphasize the sharp distinction between the rejection of an improper tender and the nonacceptance which is a breach by the buyer.</para>
<para>4. The provisions of this section are to be appropriately limited or modified when a negotiation is in process.</para>
