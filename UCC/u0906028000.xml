<para><emphasis>1. Source.</emphasis> New.</para>
<para><emphasis>2. Exculpatory Provisions.</emphasis> Subsections (a), (b), and (c) contain exculpatory provisions that should be read in conjunction with section 9-605. Without this group of provisions, a secured party could incur liability to unknown persons and under circumstances that would not allow the secured party to protect itself. The broadened definition of the term "debtor" underscores the need for these provisions.</para>
<para>If a secured party reasonably, but mistakenly, believes that a consumer transaction or consumer-goods transaction is a nonconsumer transaction or nonconsumer-goods transaction, and if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on a representation of the type specified in subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2), then this article should be applied as if the facts reasonably believed and the representation reasonably relied upon were true. For example, if a secured party reasonably believed that a transaction was a nonconsumer transaction and its belief was based on reasonable reliance on the debtor's representation that the collateral secured an obligation incurred for business purposes, the secured party is not liable to any person, and the debtor's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission of the secured party which arises out of the reasonable belief. (Nebraska removed the language "other than a consumer transaction" and did not adopt subsection (b).) Of course, if the secured party's belief is not reasonable or, even if reasonable, is not based on reasonable reliance on the debtor's representation, this limitation on liability is inapplicable.</para>
<para><emphasis>3. Inapplicability of Statutory Damages to Section 9-616.</emphasis> Subsection (d) excludes noncompliance with section 9-616 entirely from the scope of statutory damage liability under section 9-625(c)(2).</para>
<para><emphasis>4. Single Liability for Statutory Minimum Damages.</emphasis> Subsection (e) ensures that a secured party will incur statutory damages only once in connection with any one secured obligation.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
