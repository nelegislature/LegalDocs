<para>1. Delivery of goods by use of a document of title does not limit or displace the ordinary obligations of a seller or lessor as to any warranties regarding the goods that arise under other law. If the transfer of documents attends or follows the making of a contract for the sale or lease of goods, the general obligations on warranties as to the goods (sections 2-312 through 2-318 and 2A-210 through 2A-316) are brought to bear as well as the special warranties under this section.</para>
<para>2. The limited warranties of a delivering or collecting intermediary, including a collecting bank, are stated in section
7-508.</para>
