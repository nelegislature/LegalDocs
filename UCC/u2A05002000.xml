<para>This section makes clear that absent agreement to the contrary or provision in this article to the contrary, e.g., section 2A-516(3)(a), the party in default is not entitled to notice of default or enforcement. While a review of part 6 of article 9 leads to the same conclusion with respect to giving notice of default to the debtor, it is never stated. Although article 9 requires notice of disposition and strict foreclosure, the different scheme of lessors' and lessees' rights and remedies developed under the common law, and codified by this article, generally does not require notice of enforcement; furthermore, such notice is not mandated by due process requirements. However, certain sections of this article do require notice. E.g., section 2A-517(4).</para>
