<para>The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is "value" for the purpose of determining the holder's status as a holder in due course. The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. section 27) and with article 3 (section 3-303). The section does not prescribe a security interest under section 4-210 as a test of "value" generally because the meaning of "value" under other articles is adequately defined in section 1-201.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
