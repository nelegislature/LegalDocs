<para>This section replaces former section 3-114. Subsections (1) and (3) of former section 3-114 are deleted as unnecessary. Section 3-113(a) is based in part on subsection (2) of former section 3-114. The rule that a demand instrument is not payable before the date of the instrument is subject to section 4-401(c) which allows the payor bank to pay a postdated check unless the drawer has notified the bank of the postdating pursuant to a procedure prescribed in that subsection. With respect to an undated instrument, the date is the date of issue.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
