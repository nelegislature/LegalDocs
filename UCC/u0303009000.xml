<catchline>Enforcement of lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument.</catchline>
<para>(a) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person seeking to enforce the instrument (1) was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred or (2) had directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</para>
<para>(b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that proof is made, section 3-308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.</para>

<para>Under this section and section 30-2456, a successor personal representative may enforce a lost note made payable to his or her decedent if the successor proves by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the predecessor personal representative was in possession of the notes and entitled to enforce them when the loss of possession occurred; (2) the loss of possession was not the result of a voluntary transfer by predecessor or lawful seizure; and (3) possession of the notes cannot be obtained because they were either destroyed, their whereabouts cannot be determined, or they are in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person who cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process. Where an estate has insufficient funds to provide for an indemnification bond, a court's withholding of judgment from the personal representative until the statute of limitations for enforcing negotiable instruments expires is a reasonable exercise of discretion in providing adequate protection for the defendant under subsection (b) of this section. Fales v. Norine, 263 Neb. 932, 644 N.W.2d 513 (2002).</para>
<para>Under former section 3-804, the quantum of proof to recover under a lost instrument is by clear and convincing evidence. Castellano v. Bitkower, 216 Neb. 806, 346 N.W.2d 249 (1984).</para>
<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para>Section 3-309 is a modification of former section 3-804. The rights stated are those of "a person entitled to enforce the instrument" at the time of loss rather than those of an "owner" as in former section 3-804. Under subsection (b), judgment to enforce the instrument cannot be given unless the court finds that the defendant will be adequately protected against a claim to the instrument by a holder that may appear at some later time. The court is given discretion in determining how adequate protection is to be assured. Former section 3-804 allowed the court to "require security indemnifying the defendant against loss". Under section 3-309 adequate protection is a flexible concept. For example, there is substantial risk that a holder in due course may make a demand for payment if the instrument was payable to bearer when it was lost or stolen. On the other hand if the instrument was payable to the person who lost the instrument and that person did not indorse the instrument, no other person could be a holder of the instrument. In some cases there is risk of loss only if there is doubt about whether the facts alleged by the person who lost the instrument are true. Thus, the type of adequate protection that is reasonable in the circumstances may depend on the degree of certainty about the facts in the case.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
