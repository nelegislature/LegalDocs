<para><emphasis>Changes from former law:</emphasis> This section is derived from subsections (2) and (3) of former section 1-204. Subsection (1) of that section is now incorporated in section 1-302(b).</para>
<para>1. Subsection (a) makes it clear that requirements that actions be taken within a "reasonable" time are to be applied in the transactional context of the particular action.</para>
<para>2. Under subsection (b), the agreement that fixes the time need not be part of the main agreement, but may occur separately. Notice also that under the definition of "agreement" (section 1-201) the circumstances of the transaction, including course of dealing or usages of trade or course of performance may be material. On the question what is a reasonable time these matters will often be important.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
