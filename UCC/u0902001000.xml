<para><emphasis>1. Source.</emphasis> Former sections 9-201 and 9-203(4).</para>
<para><emphasis>2. Effectiveness of Security Agreement.</emphasis> Subsection (a) provides that a security agreement is generally effective. With certain exceptions, a security agreement is effective between the debtor and secured party and is likewise effective against third parties. Note that "security agreement" is used here (and elsewhere in this article) as it is defined in section 9-102: "(A)n agreement that creates or provides for a security interest". It follows that subsection (a) does not provide that every term or provision contained in a record that contains a security agreement or that is so labeled is effective. Properly read, former section 9-201 was to the same effect. Exceptions to the general rule of subsection (a) arise where there is an overriding provision in this article or any other article of the UCC. For example, section 9-317 subordinates unperfected security interests to lien creditors and certain buyers, and several provisions in part 3 subordinate some security interests to other security interests and interests of purchasers.</para>
<para><emphasis>3. Law, Statutes, and Regulations Applicable to Certain Transactions.</emphasis> Subsection (b) makes clear that certain transactions, although subject to this article, also are subject to other applicable laws relating to consumers or specified in that subsection. Subsection (c) provides that the other law is controlling in the event of a conflict, and that a violation of other law does not ipso facto constitute a violation of this article. Subsection (d) provides that this article does not validate violations under or extend the application of the other applicable laws.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
