<catchline>Identification.</catchline>
<para>Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs:</para>
<para>(a) when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified;</para>
<para>(b) when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or</para>
<para>(c) when the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.</para>

<para><emphasis>Changes:</emphasis> This section, together with section 2A-218, is derived from the provisions of section 2-501, with changes to reflect lease terminology; however, this section omits as irrelevant to leasing practice the treatment of special property.</para>
<para><emphasis>Purposes:</emphasis></para>
<para>With respect to subsection (b) there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the reference to when goods are designated, e.g., when the lessor is both selling and leasing goods to the same lessee/buyer and has marked goods for delivery but has not distinguished between those related to the lease contract and those related to the sales contract. As in section 2-501(1)(b), this issue has been left to be resolved by the courts, case by case.</para>
