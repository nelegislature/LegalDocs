<para>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the filing of a
financing statement is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest
in property subject to:</para>
<para>(1) a statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements
for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor
with respect to the property preempt section 9-310(a);</para>
<para>(2) the following statutes of this state: (i) sections 60-164 and 60-165, Reissue Revised
Statutes of Nebraska, but during any period in which collateral is inventory
held for sale by a person who is in the business of selling goods of that
kind, the filing provisions of part 5 apply to a security interest in that
collateral created by him or her as debtor; and (ii) section 37-1282, Reissue
Revised Statutes of Nebraska, but during any period in which collateral is
inventory held for sale by a person who is in the business of selling goods
of that kind, the filing provisions of part 5 apply to a security interest
in that collateral created by him or her as debtor; or</para>
<para>(3) a statute
of another jurisdiction which provides for a security interest to be indicated
on a certificate of title as a condition or result of the security
interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect
to the property.</para>
<para>(b) Compliance with the requirements of a statute, regulation, or treaty
described in subsection (a) for obtaining priority over the rights of a lien
creditor is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement under this article.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and sections 9-313 and 9-316(d)
and (e) for goods covered by a certificate of title, a security interest in
property subject to a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection
(a) may be perfected only by compliance with those requirements, and a security
interest so perfected remains perfected notwithstanding a change in the use
or transfer of possession of the collateral.</para>
<para>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and section 9-316(d)
and (e), duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected
by compliance with the requirements prescribed by a statute, regulation, or
treaty described in subsection (a) are governed by the statute, regulation,
or treaty. In other respects, the security interest is subject to this article.</para>
<para>(d) During any period in which collateral subject to a statute specified
in subdivision (a)(2) is inventory held for sale or lease by a person or leased
by that person as lessor and that person is in the business of selling goods
of that kind, this section does not apply to a security interest in that collateral
created by that person.</para>
