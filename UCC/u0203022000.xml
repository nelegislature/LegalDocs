<para>1. The delivery term, "ex-ship", as between seller and buyer, is the reverse of the F.A.S. term covered.</para>
<para>2. Delivery need not be made from any particular vessel under a clause calling for delivery "ex-ship", even though a vessel on which shipment is to be made originally is named in the contract, unless the agreement by appropriate language, restricts the clause to delivery from a named vessel.</para>
<para>3. The appropriate place and manner of unloading at the port of destination depend upon the nature of the goods and the facilities and usages of the port.</para>
<para>4. A contract fixing a price "ex-ship" with payment "cash against documents" calls only for such documents as are appropriate to the contract. Tender of a delivery order and of a receipt for the freight after the arrival of the carrying vessel is adequate. The seller is not required to tender a bill of lading as a document of title nor is he or she required to insure the goods for the buyer's benefit, as the goods are not at the buyer's risk during the voyage.</para>
