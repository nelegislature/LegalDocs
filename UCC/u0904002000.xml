<para><emphasis>2. Nonliability of Secured Party.</emphasis> This section, like former section 9-317, rejects theories on which a secured party might be held liable on a debtor's contracts or in tort merely because a security interest exists or because the debtor is entitled to dispose of or use collateral. This section expands former section 9-317 to cover agricultural liens.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
