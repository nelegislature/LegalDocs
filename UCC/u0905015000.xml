<statuteno>9-515</statuteno><catchline>Duration and effectiveness of financing
statement; effect of lapsed financing statement.</catchline><para>(a) Except
as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing
statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing.</para>
<para>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed
in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction
is effective for a period of thirty years after the date of filing if it indicates
that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home
transaction.</para>
<para>(c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration
of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation
statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement
ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that
was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security
interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural
lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected
as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</para>
<para>(d) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before
the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the
thirty-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable.</para>
<para>(e) Except as otherwise provided in section 9-510, upon timely filing
of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement
continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing
statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon
the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in
the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another
continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation
statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of
the initial financing statement.</para>
<para>(f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the
financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.</para>
<para>(g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement
filed as a fixture filing under section 9-502(c) remains effective as a financing
statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied
of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.</para>
