procedures; remedies.</catchline><para>(a) An individual personally, or as a representative of an organization,

in the affidavit. The termination statement must indicate that it was filed
pursuant to this section. Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h), a
termination statement filed under this subsection shall take effect thirty

the termination statement has been filed. The notice shall be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address provided for the secured

as to which a termination statement has been filed under subsection (d) may

is filed against the individual who filed the affidavit under subsection (a)
seeking a determination as to whether the financing statement was filed by
a person entitled to do so under section 9-509, 9-708, or 9-808. An action
under this subsection shall have priority on the court's calendar and shall
proceed by expedited hearing. The action shall be brought in the district
court of the county where the filing office in which the financing statement

in appropriate circumstances, order preliminary relief, including, but not
limited to, an order precluding the termination statement from taking effect
or directing a party to take action to prevent the termination statement from
taking effect. If the court issues such an order and the filing office receives
a certified copy of the order before the termination statement takes effect,
the termination statement shall not take effect and the filing office shall
promptly file an amendment to the financing statement that indicates that
an order has prevented the termination statement from taking effect. If such
an order ceases to be effective by reason of a subsequent order or a final
judgment of the court or by an order issued by another court and the filing

termination statement shall become immediately effective upon receipt of the
certified copy and the filing office shall promptly file an amendment to the
financing statement indicating that the termination statement is effective.</para>

statement was filed by a person entitled to do so under section 9-509, 9-708,
or 9-808 and the filing office receives a certified copy of the court's final
judgment or order before the termination statement takes effect, the termination
statement shall not take effect and the filing office shall remove the termination
statement and any amendments filed under subsection (g) from the files. If
the filing office receives the certified copy after the termination statement
takes effect and within thirty days after the final judgment or order was
entered, the filing office shall promptly file an amendment to the financing
statement that indicates that the financing statement has been reinstated.</para>
<para>(i) Except
as provided in subsection (j), upon the filing of an amendment reinstating
a financing statement under subsection (h) the effectiveness of the financing
statement is retroactively reinstated and the financing statement shall be
considered never to have been ineffective against all persons and for all
purposes.</para><para>(j) A financing statement whose effectiveness was terminated under
subsection (d) and has been reinstated under subsection (h) shall not be effective
as against a person that purchased the collateral in good faith between the
time the termination statement was filed and the time of the filing of the
amendment reinstating the financing statement, to the extent that the person
gave new value in reliance on the termination statement.</para>
<para>(k) The filing
office shall not charge a fee for the filing of an affidavit or a termination
statement under this section. The filing office shall not return any fee paid
for filing the financing statement identified in the affidavit, whether or
not the financing statement is subsequently reinstated.</para>
