<para>This article is a revision of the 1962 official text with comments as amended since 1962. The 1962 official text was a consolidation and revision of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act and the Uniform Bills of Lading Act, and embraced the provisions of the Uniform Sales Act relating to negotiation of documents of title.</para>
<para>This article does not contain the substantive criminal provisions found in the Uniform Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading Acts. These criminal provisions are inappropriate to a commercial code, and for the most part duplicate portions of the ordinary criminal law relating to frauds. This revision deletes the former section 7-105 that provided that courts could apply a rule from parts 2 and 3 by analogy to a situation not explicitly covered in the provisions on warehouse receipts or bills of lading when it was appropriate. This is, of course, an unexceptional proposition and need not be stated explicitly in the statute. Thus former section 7-105 has been deleted. Whether applying a rule by analogy to a situation is appropriate depends upon the facts of each case.</para>
<para>The article does not attempt to define the tort liability of bailees, except to hold certain classes of bailees to a minimum standard of reasonable care. For important classes of bailees, liabilities in case of loss, damages, or destruction, as well as other legal questions associated with particular documents of title, are governed by federal statutes, international treaties, and in some cases regulatory state laws, which supersede the provisions of this article in case of inconsistency. See section 7-103.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
