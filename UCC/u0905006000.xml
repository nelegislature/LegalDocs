<para>(a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements
of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless
the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</para>
<para>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to
provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 9-503(a) is seriously
misleading.</para>
<para>(c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's
correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would
disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name
of the debtor in accordance with section 9-503(a), the name provided does
not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</para>
<para>(d) For purposes of section 9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in
subsection (c) means
the correct name of the new debtor.</para>
