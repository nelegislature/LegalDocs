<para>1. Section captions are a part of the text of the Uniform Commercial Code, and not mere surplusage. This is not the case, however, with respect to subsection headings appearing in article 9. See comment 3 to section 9-101 ("subsection headings are not a part of the official text itself and have not been approved by the sponsors").</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
