<para>An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank, whether made with or without fraudulent intent, does not relieve the issuer of its liability on the document as originally executed. This section applies to both tangible and electronic bills of lading, applying the same rule to both types of bills of lading. The control concept of section 7-106 requires that any changes to the
electronic document of title be readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized. Section 7-306 should be compared to section 7-208 where a different rule applies to the unauthorized filling in of a blank for tangible warehouse receipts.</para>
