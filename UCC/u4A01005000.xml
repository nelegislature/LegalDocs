<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para>1. The definition of "bank" in subsection (a)(2) includes some institutions
that are not commercial banks. The definition reflects the fact that many
financial institutions now perform functions previously restricted to commercial
banks, including acting on behalf of customers in funds transfers. Since many
funds transfers involve payment orders to or from foreign countries the definition
also covers foreign banks. The definition also includes Federal Reserve banks.
Funds transfers carried out by Federal Reserve banks are described in comments
1 and 2 to section 4A-107.</para>
<para>2. Funds-transfer business is frequently transacted by banks outside
of general banking hours. Thus, the definition of banking day in section 4-104(a)(3)
cannot be used to describe when a bank is open for funds-transfer business.
Subsection (a)(4) defines a new term, "funds-transfer business day", which
is applicable to article 4A. The definition states, "is open for the receipt,
processing, and transmittal of payment orders and cancellations and amendments
of payment orders". In some cases it is possible to electronically transmit
payment orders and other communications to a receiving bank at any time. If
the receiving bank is not open for the processing of an order when it is received,
the communication is stored in the receiving bank's computer for retrieval
when the receiving bank is open for processing. The use of the conjunctive
makes clear that the defined term is limited to the period during which all
functions of the receiving bank can be performed, i.e., receipt, processing,
and transmittal of payment orders, cancellations, and amendments.</para>
<para>3. Subsection (a)(5) defines "funds-transfer system". The term includes
a system such as CHIPS which provides for transmission of a payment order
as well as settlement of the obligation of the sender to pay the order. It
also includes automated clearinghouses, operated by a clearinghouse or other
association of banks, which process and transmit payment orders of banks to
other banks. In addition the term includes organizations that provide only
transmission services such as SWIFT. The definition also includes the wire
transfer network and automated clearinghouses of Federal Reserve banks. Systems
of the Federal Reserve banks, however, are treated differently from systems
of other associations of banks. Funds-transfer systems other than systems
of the Federal Reserve banks are treated in article 4A as a means of communication
of payment orders between participating banks. Section 4A-206. The comment
to that section and the comment to section 4A-107 explain how Federal Reserve
banks function under article 4A. Funds-transfer systems are also able to promulgate
rules binding on participating banks that, under section 4A-501, may supplement
or in some cases may even override provisions of article 4A.</para>
<para>4. Subsection (d) incorporates definitions stated in article 1 as well
as principles of construction and interpretation stated in that article. Included
is section 1-103. The last paragraph of the comment to section 4A-102 is addressed
to the issue of the extent to which general principles of law and equity should
apply to situations covered by provisions of article 4A.</para></annotation>
