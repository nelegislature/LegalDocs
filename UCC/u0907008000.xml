<para>This section permits a secured party to file an initial financing statement or continuation statement necessary under this part to continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001, or to perfect or otherwise continue the perfection of a security interest. Because a filing described in this section typically operates to continue the effectiveness of a financing statement whose filing the debtor already has authorized, this section does not require authorization from the debtor.</para></annotation></law></legaldoc>
