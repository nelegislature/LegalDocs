or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in a deposit account

<para>(b) The following rules determine a bank's jurisdiction for purposes
of this part:</para>
<para>(1) If an agreement between the bank and its

is the bank's jurisdiction.</para>

<para><emphasis>COMMENT</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>1. Source.</emphasis> New; derived from section 8-110(e) and former section 9-103(6).</para>
<para><emphasis>2. Deposit Accounts.</emphasis> Under this section, the law of the "bank's jurisdiction" governs perfection and priority of a security interest in deposit accounts. Subsection (b) contains rules for determining the "bank's jurisdiction". The substance of these rules is substantially similar to that of the rules determining the "security intermediary's jurisdiction" under former section 8-110(e), except that subsection (b)(1) provides more flexibility than the analogous provision in former section 8-110(e)(1). Subsection (b)(1) permits the parties to choose the law of one jurisdiction to govern perfection and priority of security interests and a different governing law for other purposes. The parties' choice is effective, even if the jurisdiction whose law is chosen bears no relationship to the parties or the transaction. Section 8-110(e)(1) has been conformed to subsection (b)(1) of this section, and section 9-305(b)(1), concerning a commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, makes a similar departure from former section 9-103(6)(e)(i).</para>
<para><emphasis>3. Change in Law Governing Perfection.</emphasis> When the bank's jurisdiction changes, the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection under subsection (a) changes, as well. Nevertheless, the change will not result in an immediate loss of perfection. See section 9-316(f) and (g).</para></annotation>  </law>
