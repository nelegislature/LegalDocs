<para>The bailee's liability on its document despite nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods is affirmed in sections 7-203 and
7-301. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that regardless of irregularities a document which falls within the
definition of document of title imposes on the issuer the obligations stated in this article. For example, a bailee will not
be permitted to avoid its obligation to deliver the goods (section 7-403) or its obligation of due care with respect to them
(sections 7-204 and 7-309) by taking the position that no valid "document" was issued because it failed to file a statutory bond
or did not pay stamp taxes or did not disclose the place of storage in the document. Tate v. Action Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 383 S.E.2d 229 (N.C. App. 1989), rev. denied 389 S.E.2d 104 (N.C. 1990). Sanctions against violations of statutory or administrative duties with respect to documents should be limited to revocation of license or other measures prescribed by
the regulation imposing the duty. See section 7-103.</para>
