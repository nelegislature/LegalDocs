This clause is used throughout the official comments to this article to indicate the scope of change in the provisions of the uniform statutory source included in the section; these changes range from one extreme, e.g., a significant difference in practice (a warranty as to merchantability is not implied in a finance lease (section 2A-212)) to the other extreme, e.g., a modest difference in style or terminology (the transaction governed is a lease not a sale (section 2A-103)).</para>
