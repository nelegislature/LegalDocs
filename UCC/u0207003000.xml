<para>1. This section is an index section which gathers together in one convenient place all of the various remedies open to a seller for any breach by the buyer. This article rejects any doctrine of election of remedy as a fundamental policy and thus the remedies are essentially cumulative in nature and include all of the available remedies for breach. Whether the pursuit of one remedy bars another depends entirely on the facts of the individual case.</para>
<para>2. The buyer's breach which occasions the use of the remedies under this section may involve only one lot or delivery of goods, or may involve all of the goods which are the subject matter of the particular contract. The right of the seller to pursue a remedy as to all the goods when the breach is as to only one or more lots is covered by the section on breach in installment contracts. The present section deals only with the remedies available after the goods involved in the breach have been determined by that section.</para>
<para>3. In addition to the typical case of refusal to pay or default in payment, the language in the preamble, "fails to make a payment due", is intended to cover the dishonor of a check on due presentment, or the nonacceptance of a draft, and the failure to furnish an agreed letter of credit.</para>
<para>4. It should also be noted that the code requires its remedies to be liberally administered and provides that any right or obligation which it declares is enforceable by action unless a different effect is specifically prescribed (section 1-106).</para>
