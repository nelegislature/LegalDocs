Criminal prosecutions</emphasis></para><para>Under this provision, in a criminal prosecution, the State must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt and may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming an ingredient upon proof of the other elements of the offense. Because the burden of proof always remains with the State, it cannot comment on a defendant's failure to produce evidence to refute an element of the crime, because doing so could erroneously lead the jury to believe that the defendant carried the burden of introducing evidence. The exception to this rule is when the defendant voluntarily assumes some burden of proof by asserting the defenses of alibi, of self-defense, and of others, relying on facts that could be elicited only from a witness who is not equally available to the State. While a defendant may invite the State to explain why it chose not to submit certain items for testing, a defendant in a criminal case can never open the door to shift the burden of proof. A defendant is entitled to inquire about weaknesses in the State's case, but this does not open the door for the State to point out that the defendant has not proved his or her innocence. State v. Rocha, 295 Neb. 716, 890 N.W.2d 178 (2017).</para><para>The Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions preclude admissibility of an involuntary confession. State v.

In order to prove that a defendant's race unconstitutionally taints enforcement of the death penalty, the defendant must at a minimum establish that the decision to enforce the death penalty is based on a conscious discriminatory purpose, resulting in a discriminatory effect suffered by the defendant. A defendant has a life interest in connection with the imposition of the death penalty and is entitled to due process in the imposition of the sentence. State v. Reeves, 258 Neb. 511, 604 N.W.2d 151 (2000).</para><para>This section provides that no person shall be deprived of liberty "without due process of law", and article I, section 11, provides that the accused in a criminal prosecution shall have the right to "trial by an impartial jury".

    <para><emphasis>1. Expectation of privacy</emphasis></para><para>In Nebraska, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures is guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. IV and Neb. Const. art. I, sec. 7. To determine whether an individual has an interest protected by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Neb. Const. art. I, sec. 7, one must determine whether an individual has a legitimate or justifiable expectation of privacy in the place subjected to canine scrutiny. Ordinarily, two inquiries are required. First, the individual must have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy, and second, the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. By using a canine to sniff for illegal drugs in a hallway outside an apartment, the police have engaged an investigative technique by which they are able to obtain information regarding the contents of a place that has traditionally been accorded a heightened expectation of privacy, and while such investigative technique may be minimally intrusive, it nevertheless implicates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Neb. Const. art. I, sec. 7, and requires independent reasonable suspicion. Under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Neb. Const. art. I, sec. 7, an occupant has a legitimate expectation of some measure of privacy in the hallway immediately outside his or her apartment or at the threshold of his or her home. Given such constitutional protection, before a drug-detecting canine can be deployed to test the threshold of a home, police officers must possess at a minimum reasonable, articulable suspicion that the location to be tested contains illegal drugs. State v. Ortiz, 257 Neb. 784, 600 N.W.2d 805 (1999).</para><para>A defendant is guaranteed the right to be secure in his person, house, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.

State v. Trahan, 229 Neb. 683, 428 N.W.2d 619 (1988).</para><para>A person's capacity to claim the protection of this section as to unreasonable searches and seizures, like its counterpart, U.S. Const. amend. IV, depends upon whether the person who claims such protection has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place. An unreasonable search occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed. Because the defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the searched premises, they were without standing to claim a violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV in regard to the search of their former residence. State v. Hodge and Carpenter, 225 Neb. 94, 402 N.W.2d 867 (1987).</para><para>The failure of an individual to secure his vehicle decreased his expectation of privacy relating to the vehicle. State v.

Search warrant</emphasis></para><para>A search warrant authorizing the search of a murder suspect's residence for "any and all firearms" sufficiently described the things to be seized with particularity; even though the particular caliber of the firearm was not specified, the warrant still told police with reasonable clarity which items to search for and seize and did not give police open-ended discretion. State v. Baker, 298 Neb. 216, 903 N.W.2d 469 (2017).</para><para>The particularity requirement of this provision demands that a warrant describe with particularity (1) the place to be searched and (2) the persons or things to be seized. State v. Baker, 298 Neb. 216, 903 N.W.2d 469 (2017).</para><para>The particularity requirement of this provision is distinct from, but closely related to, the requirement that a warrant be supported by probable cause. A warrant may be sufficiently particular even though it describes the items to be seized in broad or generic terms if the description is as particular as the supporting evidence will allow; but the broader the scope of a warrant, the stronger the evidentiary showing must be to establish probable cause. State v. Baker, 298 Neb. 216, 903 N.W.2d 469 (2017).</para><para>The ultimate touchstone of this provision is reasonableness. Searches and seizures must not be unreasonable. Searches without a valid warrant are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions. State v. Rocha, 295 Neb. 716, 890 N.W.2d 178 (2017).</para><para>Provision in a warrant authorizing the police to search for "[a]ny and all firearms" was sufficiently particular. State v.

<para>A search pursuant to a warrant is presumed valid.

This inquiry does not focus on the likelihood of the vehicle's being moved under the particular circumstances and is generally satisfied by the inherent mobility of all operational vehicles. It does not depend on whether the defendant has access to the vehicle at the time of the search or is in custody, nor on whether the vehicle has been impounded. State v.

<para>In order to determine whether a fine challenged under this provision is grossly disproportional, the claimant must first make a prima facie showing of gross disproportionality, and if the claimant does so, the court then considers whether the disproportionality reaches such a level of excessiveness that the punishment is more criminal than the crime.

<catchline>First power reserved; initiative.</catchline>
<para>The first power reserved by the people is the initiative whereby laws may be enacted and constitutional amendments adopted by the people independently of the Legislature. This power may be invoked by petition wherein the proposed measure shall be set forth at length. If the petition be for the enactment of a law, it shall be signed by seven percent of the registered voters of the state, and if the petition be for the amendment of the Constitution, the petition therefor shall be signed by ten percent of such registered voters. In all cases the registered voters signing such petition shall be so distributed as to include five percent of the registered voters of each of two-fifths of the counties of the state, and when thus signed, the petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State who shall submit the measure thus proposed to the electors of the state at the first general election held not less than four months after such petition shall have been filed. The same measure, either in form or in essential substance, shall not be submitted to the people by initiative petition, either affirmatively or negatively, more often than once in three years. If conflicting measures submitted to the  people at the same election be approved, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall thereby become law as to all conflicting provisions. The constitutional limitations as to the scope and subject matter of statutes enacted by the Legislature shall apply to those enacted by the initiative. Initiative measures shall contain only one subject. The Legislature shall not amend, repeal, modify, or impair a law enacted by the people by initiative, contemporaneously with the adoption of this initiative measure or at any time thereafter, except upon a vote of at least two-thirds of all the members of the Legislature.</para>

<para>The whole number of votes cast for Governor at the general election next preceding the filing of an initiative or referendum petition shall be the basis on which the number of signatures to such petition shall be computed. The veto power of the Governor shall not extend to measures initiated by or referred to the people.

The method of submitting and adopting amendments to the Constitution provided by this section shall be supplementary to the method prescribed in the article of this Constitution, entitled, "Amendments" and the latter shall in no case be construed to conflict herewith. The provisions with respect to the initiative and referendum shall be self-executing, but legislation may be enacted to facilitate their operation. All propositions submitted in pursuance hereof shall be submitted in a non-partisan manner and without any indication or suggestion on the ballot that they have been approved or endorsed by any political party or organization. Only the title or proper descriptive words of measures shall be printed on the ballot and when two or more measures have the same title they shall be numbered consecutively in the order of filing with the Secretary of State and the number shall be followed by the name of the first petitioner on the corresponding petition.</para>

<catchline>Judges; discipline; removal from office; grounds; procedure.</catchline>
<para>(1) A Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or judge of any court of this state may be reprimanded, disciplined, censured, suspended without pay for a definite period of time, not to exceed six months, or removed from office for (a) willful misconduct in office, (b) willful disregard of or failure to perform his or her duties, (c) habitual intemperance, (d) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, (e) disbarment as a member of the legal profession licensed to practice law in the State of Nebraska, or (f) conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or he or she may be retired for physical or mental disability seriously interfering with the performance of his or her duties if such disability is determined to be permanent or reasonably likely to become permanent. Any citizen of the State of Nebraska may request the Commission on Judicial Qualifications to consider the qualifications of any Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge, and in such event the commission shall make such investigation as the commission deems necessary and shall, upon a finding of probable cause, reprimand such Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge or order a formal open hearing to be held before it concerning the reprimand, discipline, censure, suspension, removal, or retirement of such Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge. In the alternative or in addition, the commission may request the Supreme Court to appoint one or more special masters who shall be judges of courts of record to hold a formal open hearing to take evidence in any such matter, and to report to the commission. If, after formal open hearing, or after considering the record and report of the masters, the commission finds that the charges are established by clear and convincing evidence, it shall recommend to the Supreme Court that the Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge involved shall be reprimanded, disciplined, censured, suspended without pay for a definite period of time not to exceed six months, removed, or retired as the case may be.</para>
<para>(2) The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings and in its discretion may permit the introduction of additional evidence. The Supreme Court shall make such determination as it finds just and proper, and may order the reprimand, discipline, censure, suspension, removal, or retirement of such Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge, or may wholly reject the recommendation. Upon an order for retirement, the Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge shall thereby be retired with the same rights and privileges as if he or she had retired pursuant to statute. Upon an order for removal, the Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge shall be removed from office, his or her salary shall cease from the date of such order, and he or she shall be ineligible for judicial office. Upon an order for suspension, the Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge shall draw no salary and shall perform no judicial functions during the period of suspension. Suspension shall not create a vacancy in the office of Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge.</para>
<para>(3) Upon order of the Supreme Court, a Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge shall be disqualified from acting as a Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge, without loss of salary, while there is pending (a) an indictment or information charging him or her in the United States with a crime punishable as a felony under Nebraska or federal law or (b) a recommendation to the Supreme Court by the Commission on Judicial Qualifications for his or her removal or retirement.</para>
<para>(4) In addition to the procedure set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, on recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications or on its own motion, the Supreme Court (a) shall remove a Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge from office when in any court in the United States such justice or judge pleads guilty or no contest to a crime punishable as a felony under Nebraska or federal law, and (b) may suspend a Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge from office without salary when in any court in the United States such justice or judge is found guilty of a crime punishable as a felony under Nebraska or federal law or of any other crime that involves moral turpitude. If his or her conviction is reversed, suspension shall terminate and he or she shall be paid his or her salary for the period of suspension. If he or she is suspended and his or her conviction becomes final the Supreme Court shall remove him or her from office.</para>
<para>(5) All papers filed with and proceedings before the commission or masters appointed by the Supreme Court pursuant to this section prior to a reprimand or formal open hearing shall be confidential. The filing of papers with and the testimony given before the commission or masters or the Supreme Court shall be deemed a privileged communication.</para>
<para>When the Commission on Judicial Qualifications determines that disciplinary action is warranted, whether it be a reprimand or otherwise, the Commission on Judicial Qualifications shall issue one or more short announcements confirming that a complaint has been filed; stating the subject and nature of the complaint, the disciplinary action recommended or reprimand issued, or the date of the hearing; clarifying the procedural aspects; and reciting the right of a judge to a fair hearing.</para>
<para>When the Commission on Judicial Qualifications determines that disciplinary action is not warranted, and the existence of any investigation or complaint has become publicly known, the judge against whom a complaint has been filed or investigation commenced may waive the confidentiality of papers and proceedings under this subsection.</para>
<para>The Supreme Court shall by rule provide for procedure under this section before the commission, the masters, and the Supreme Court.</para>
<para>(6) No Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court or other judge shall participate, as a member of the commission, or as a master, or as a member of the Supreme Court, in any proceedings involving his or her own reprimand, discipline, censure, suspension, removal, or retirement.</para>

Constitution to establish term limits on Congress that will ensure representation
in Congress by true citizen lawmakers. The President of the United States
is limited by the XXII Amendment to the United States Constitution to two
terms in office. Governors in forty states are limited to two terms or less.
 Voters have established term limits for over two thousand state legislators
as well as over seventeen thousand local officials across the country. Nevertheless,
Congress has ignored our desire for term limits not only by proposing excessively
long terms for its own members but also by utterly refusing to pass an amendment
for genuine congressional term limits. Congress has a clear conflict of interest
in proposing a term limits amendment to the United States Constitution. A
majority of both Republicans and Democrats in the 104th Congress voted against
a constitutional amendment containing the term limits passed by a wide margin
of Nebraska voters. The people, not Congress, should set term limits. We
hereby establish as the official position of the citizens and State of Nebraska
that our elected officials should enact by constitutional amendment congressional
term limits of three terms in the United States House of Representatives and
of two terms in the United States Senate.</para>
<para>The career politicians dominating Congress have a conflict of interest
that prevents Congress from being what the founders intended, the branch of
government closest to the people. The politicians have refused to heed the
will of the people for term limits; they have voted to dramatically raise
their own pay; they have provided lavish million-dollar pensions for themselves;
and they have granted themselves numerous other privileges at the expense
of the people. Most importantly, members of Congress have enriched themselves
while running up huge deficits to support their spending. They have put the
government nearly $5,000,000,000,000.00 (five trillion dollars) in debt, gravely
threatening the future of our children and grandchildren.</para>
<para>The corruption and appearance of corruption brought about by political
careerism is destructive to the proper functioning of the first branch of
our representative government. Congress has grown increasingly distant from
the people of the states. The people have the sovereign right and compelling
interest in creating a citizen Congress that will more effectively protect
our freedom and prosperity. This interest and right may not effectively be
served in any way other than that proposed by this initiative.</para>
<para>We hereby state our intention on behalf of the people of Nebraska, that
this initiative lead to the adoption of the following amendment to the United
States Constitution:</para>
<para>CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS AMENDMENT TO</para>
<para>THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION</para>
<para>Section 1. No person shall serve in the office of United States Representative
for more than three terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person
who has held the office of United States Representative or who then holds
the office shall serve for more than two additional terms.</para>
<para>Section 2. No person shall serve in the office of United States Senator
for more than two terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person
who has held the office of United States Senator or who then holds the office
shall serve for more than one additional term.</para>
<para>Section 3. This article shall have no time limit within which it must
be ratified to become operative upon the ratification of the legislatures
of three-fourths of the several states.</para><para>Therefore, we the people of the State
of Nebraska, have chosen to amend the Constitution of Nebraska to inform voters
regarding incumbent and nonincumbent federal and state candidates' support
for the congressional term limits amendment provided for in this section.</para>
